<head>Translator's Preface</head>

<p>
Prominent among the stones of a fireplace in my
country den, one large rounded giant stands out. It
was bourne by the glacial streams from a more
northern resting place and is marked by a fossil of
a mollusk that inhabited northern seas many million
years ago. Yet in spite of the eons of time that
have passed it can be compared with specimens of
mollusks that live to-day. Down through the countless
centuries the living stream has carved its structural
habitations in much the same form. The science
of Paleontology has collected this history and
has attempted a reconstruction of life from its beginnings.
</p>

<p>
The same principle here illustrated is true for the
thought-life of mankind. The forms in which it
has been preserved however are not so evident.
The structuralizations are not so definite. If
they were, evolution would not have been possible
for the living stream of energy which is utilized by
mind-stuff cannot be confined if it would advance to
more complex integrations. Hence the products of
mind in evolution are more plastic&mdash;more subtle
<pb n="iv"/><anchor id="Pgiv"/>
and more changing. They are to be found in the
myths and the folk-lore of ancient peoples, the
poetry, dramatic art, and the language of later races.
From age to age however the strivings continue the
same. The living vessels must continue and the
products express the most fundamental strivings, in
varying though related forms.
</p>

<p>
We thus arrive at a science which may be called
paleo-psychology. Its fossils are the thought-forms
throughout the ages, and such a science seeks to show
fundamental likenesses behind the more superficial
dissimilarities.
</p>

<p>
The present work is a contribution to such a science
in that it shows the essential relationships of
what is found in the unconscious of present day mankind
to many forms of thinking of the middle ages.
These same trends are present to-day in all of us
though hidden behind a different set of structural
terms, utilizing different mechanisms for energy expression.
</p>

<p>
The unceasing complexity of life's accumulations
has created a great principle for energy expression&mdash;it
is termed sublimation&mdash;and in popular parlance
represents the spiritual striving of mankind
towards the perfecting of a relation with the world
of reality&mdash;the environment&mdash;which shall mean
human happiness in its truest sense. One of the
<pb n="v"/><anchor id="Pgv"/>
products of this sublimation tendency is called Mysticism.
This work would seek to aid us to an understanding
of this manifestation of human conduct as
expressed in concrete or contemplated action through
thought. It does so by the comparative method,
and it is for this reason I have been led to present
it to an English reading public.
</p>

<p>
Much of the strange and outre, as well as the commonplace,
in human activity conceals energy transformations
of inestimable value in the work of sublimation.
The race would go mad without it. It
sometimes does even with it, a sign that sublimation
is still imperfect and that the race is far from being
spiritually well. A comprehension of the principles
here involved would further the spread of sympathy
for all forms of thinking and tend to further spiritual
health in such mutual comprehension of the
needs of others and of the forms taken by sublimation
processes.
</p>

<p>
For the actual work of translation, I wish to express
my obligations to friends Wilfred Lay, and
Leo Stein. Without their generous and gifted assistance
I would not have been able to accomplish
the task.

<p>
In an old book I discovered an extraordinary
narrative entitled Parabola. I take it as the starting
point of my observations because it affords a
welcome guide. In the endeavor to understand the
parable and get a psychological insight into it, we
are led on to journey through these very realms of
fancy, into which I should like to conduct the reader.
At the end of our journey we shall have acquired,
with the understanding of the first example, the
knowledge of certain psychical laws.
</p>

<p>
I shall, then, without further prelude introduce
the example, and purposely avoid at the outset mentioning
the title of the old book so that the reader
may be in a position to allow the narrative to affect
him without any preconceived ideas. Explanatory
interpolations in the text, which come from me, I
distinguish with square brackets.
</p>

<p>
[1]. As once I strolled in a fair forest, young and green,
and contemplated the painfulness of this life, and lamented
how through the dire fall of our first parents we inherited
<pb n="002"/><anchor id="Pg002"/>
such misery and distress, I chanced, while thinking these
thoughts, to depart from the usual path, and found myself,
I know not how, on a narrow foot path that was rough,
untrodden and impassable, and overgrown with so much
underbrush and bushes that it was easy to see it was very
little used. Therefore I was dismayed and would gladly
have gone back, but it was not in my power to do so, since
a strong wind so powerfully blew me on, that I could rather
take ten steps in advance than one backward.
</p>

<p>
[2]. Therefore I had to go on and not mind the rough
walking.
</p>

<p>
[3]. After I had advanced a good while I came finally to
a lovely meadow hedged about with a round circle of fruit
bearing trees, and called by the dwellers <hi rend='italic'>Pratum felicitatis</hi>
[the meadow of felicity], I was in the midst of a company
of old men with beards as gray as ice, except for one
who was quite a young man with a pointed black beard.
Also there was among them one whose name was well known
to me, but his visage I could not yet see, who was still
younger, and they debated on all kinds of subjects, particularly
about a great and lofty mystery, hidden in Nature,
which God kept concealed from the great world, and revealed
to only a few who loved him.
</p>

<p>
[4]. I listened long and their discourse pleased me well,
only some would break forth from restraint, not touching
upon the matter or work, but what touched upon the parables,
similitudes and other parerga, in which they followed
the poetic fancies of Aristotle, Pliny and others which the
one had copied from the other. So I could contain myself
no longer and mixed in my own mustard, [put in my own
word], refuted such trivial things from experience, and the
majority sided with me, examined me in their faculty and
made it quite hot for me. However the foundation of my
knowledge was so good, that I passed with all honors, whereupon
<pb n="003"/><anchor id="Pg003"/>
they all were amazed, unanimously included and admitted
me in their collegium, of which I was heartily glad.
</p>

<p>
[5]. But they said I could not be a real colleague till I
learned to know their lion, and became thoroughly acquainted
with his powers and abilities. For that purpose I
should use diligence so as to subdue him. I was quite confident
in myself and promised them I would do my best.
For their company pleased me so well that I would not have
parted from them for a great deal.
</p>

<p>
[6]. They led me to the lion and described him very carefully,
but what I should undertake with him none could
tell me. Some of them indeed hinted, but very darkly, so
that the (Der Tausende) Thousandth one could not have
understood him. But when I should first succeed in subduing
him and should have assured myself against his sharp
claws, and keen teeth, then they would conceal nothing from
me. Now the lion was very old, ferocious and large, his
yellow hair hung over his neck, he appeared quite unconquerable,
so that I was almost afraid of my temerity and
would gladly have turned back if my promise and also the
circumstance that the elders stood about me and were waiting
to see what I would do, had allowed me to give up.
In great confidence I approached the lion in his den and
began to caress him, but he looked at me so fiercely with his
brightly shining eyes that I could hardly restrain my tears.
Just then I remembered that I had learned from one of the
elders, while we were going to the lion's den, that very
many people had undertaken to overcome the lion and very
few could accomplish it. I was unwilling to be disgraced,
and I recalled several grips that I had learned with great
diligence in athletics, besides which I was well versed in
natural magic [magia] so I gave up the caresses and seized
the lion so dextrously, artfully and subtlely, that before he
was well aware of it I forced the blood out of his body,
<pb n="004"/><anchor id="Pg004"/>
yea, even out of his heart. It was beautifully red but very
choleric. I dissected him further and found, a fact which
caused me much wonder, that his bones were white as snow
and there was much more bone than there was blood.
</p>

<p>
[7]. Now when my dear elders, who stood above around
the den and looked at me, were aware of it, they disputed
earnestly with each other, for so much I could infer from
their motions but what they said I could not hear since I was
deep down in the den. Yet as they came close in dispute I
heard that one said, <q>He must bring him to life again, else
he can not be our colleague.</q> I was unwilling to undertake
further difficulties, and betook myself out of the den to a
great place, and came, I know not how, on a very high wall,
whose height rose over 100 ells towards the clouds, but on
top was not one foot wide. And there went up from the
beginning, where I ascended, to the end an iron hand rail
right along the center of the wall, with many leaded supports.
On this wall I came, I say, and meseems there went
on the right side of the railing a man several paces before
me.
</p>

<p>
[8]. But as I followed him awhile I saw another following
me on the other side, yet it was doubtful whether
man or woman, that called to me and said that it was better
walking on his side than where I went, as I readily believed,
because the railing that stood near the middle made the path
so narrow that the going at such a height was very bad.
Then I saw also some that wished to go on that path, fall:
down below behind me, therefore I swung under the railing;
holding tight with my hands and went forward on the other
[left] side, till I finally came to a place on the wall which
was very precipitous and dangerous to descend. Then first
I repented that I had not stayed on the other [right] side
and I could not go under to the other side as it was also
impossible to turn round and get on the other path. So I
<pb n="005"/><anchor id="Pg005"/>
risked it, trusted to my good feet, held myself tight and
came down without harm, and as I walked a little further,
looked and knew of no other danger, but also knew not what
had become of wall and railing.
</p>

<p>
[9]. After I came down, there stood in that place a beautiful
rose bush, on which beautiful red and white roses were
growing, the red more numerous, however, than the white.
I broke off some roses from the bush and put them on my
hat. But there seemed to be in the same place a wall, surrounding
a great garden. In the garden were lads, and
their lasses who would gladly be in the garden, but would
not wander widely, or take the trouble to come to the gates.
So I pitied them. I went further along the path by which
I had come, still on the level, and went so fast that I soon
came to some houses, where I supposed I should find the
gardener's house. But I found there many people, each having
his own room. They were slow. Two together they
worked diligently, yet each had his own work. [The meaning
may be either that working alone they were slow, but
in twos they worked diligently; or two of them worked together
and were diligent. Both amount to the same thing
as we shall later realize.] But what they did, it seems, I
had myself done before and all their work was familiar to
me. Especially, thought I, see, if so many other people do
so much dirty and sloppy work, that is only an appearance
according to each one's conceit, but has no reason in Nature,
so it may also be pardoned in you. I wished, therefore,
because I knew such tricks vanished like smoke, to remain
here no longer in vain and proceeded on my former
way.
</p>

<p>
[10]. After I had arrived at the gate of the garden, some
on one side looked sourly at me, so that I was afraid they
might hinder me in my project; but others said, <q>See, he
will into the garden, and we have done garden service here
<pb n="006"/><anchor id="Pg006"/>
so long, and have never gotten in; we will laugh him down
if he fails.</q> But I did not regard all that, as I knew the
conditions of this garden better than they, even if I had
never been in it, but went right to a gate that was tight shut
so that one could neither see nor find a keyhole. I noticed,
however, that a little round hole that with ordinary eyes
could not be seen, was in the door, and thought immediately,
that must be the way the door is opened, was ready with my
specially prepared Diederich, unlocked and went in. When
I was inside the door, I found several other bolted doors,
which I yet opened without trouble. Here, however, was a
passage way, just as if it was in a well built house, some
six feet wide and twenty long, with a roof above. And
though the other doors were still locked, I could easily see
through them into the garden as the first door was open.
</p>

<p>
[11]. I wandered into the garden in God's name, and
found in the midst of it a small garden, that was square
and six roods long, hedged in with rose thorns, and the roses
bloomed beautifully. But as it was raining gently, and the
sun shone in it, it caused a very lovely rainbow. When I
had passed beyond the little garden and would go to the
place where I was to help the maids, behold I was aware that
instead of the walls a low hurdle stood there, and there
went along by the rose garden the most beautiful maiden
arrayed in white satin, with the most stately youth, who
was in scarlet each giving arm to the other, and carrying
in their hands many fragrant roses. I spoke to them and
asked them how they had come over the hurdle. <q>This,
my beloved bridegroom,</q> said she, <q>has helped me over, and
we are going now out of this beautiful garden into our apartment
to enjoy the pleasures of love.</q> <q>I am glad,</q> said
I, <q>that without any further trouble on my part your desires
are satisfied; yet see how I have hurried, and have run
so long a way in so short a time to serve you.</q> After that
<pb n="007"/><anchor id="Pg007"/>
I came into a great mill built inside of stones, in which were
no flour bins or other things that pertained to grinding but
one saw through the walls several water wheels going in
water. I asked why it had equipment for grinding. An
old miller answered that the mill was shut down on the
other side. Just then I also saw a miller's boy go in from
the sluice plank [Schutzensteg], and I followed after him.
When I had come over the plank [Steg], which had the
water wheels on the left, I stood still and was amazed at
what I saw there. For the wheels were now higher than
the plank, the water coal black, but its drops were yet white,
and the sluice planks were not over three fingers wide.
Still I ventured back and held onto the sticks that were
over the sluice planks and so came safely and dry over the
water. Then I asked the old miller how many water wheels
he had. <q>Ten,</q> answered he. The adventure stuck in
my mind. I should have gladly known what the meaning
was. But as I noticed that the miller would not leave I
went away, and there was in front of the mill a lofty paved
hill, on which were some of the previously mentioned elders
who walked in the sun, which then shone very warm, and
they had a letter from the whole faculty written to them,
on which they were consulting. [In our modern mode of
expression, the elders had directed a letter to the sun, and
so I find the passage in an English version of the parable.
This generally bungling translation is nevertheless not in the
least authoritative. And although an acceptable meaning is
derived from it, if one regards the sun as the just mentioned
<q>prince,</q> yet I believe a freer translation should be given ...
the elders walked in the warm sunshine; they consulted
about a letter written to them by the faculty.] I
soon noticed what the contents must be, and that it concerned
me. I went therefore to them and said, <q>Gentlemen,
does it concern me?</q> <q>Yes,</q> said they, <q>you must
<pb n="008"/><anchor id="Pg008"/>
keep in marriage the woman that you have recently taken
or we must notify our prince.</q> I said, <q>that is no trouble
as I was born at the same time as she and brought up as a
child with her, and as I have taken her once I will keep her
forever, and death itself shall not part us, for I have an
ardent affection for her.</q> <q>What have we then to complain
of?</q> replied they. <q>The bride is content, and we
have your will; you must copulate.</q> <q>Contented,</q> said I.
<q>Well,</q> said one, <q>the lion will then regain his life and become
more powerful and mighty than before.</q>
</p>

<p>
[12]. Then occurred to me my previous trouble and
labor and I thought to myself that for particular reasons it
must not concern me but some other that is well known to
me; then I saw our bridegroom and his bride go by in their
previous attire, ready and prepared for copulation, which
gave me great joy, for I was in great distress lest the thing
might concern me.
</p>

<p>
[13]. When, then, as mentioned, our bridegroom in his
brilliant scarlet clothes with his dearest bride, whose white
satin coat shot forth bright rays, came to the proper marriage
age, they joined the two so quickly that I wondered
not a little that this maid, that was supposed to be the mother
of the bridegroom, was still so young that she appeared to
be just born.
</p>

<p>
[14]. Now I do not know what sin these two must have
committed except that although they were brother and sister,
they were in such wise bound by ties of love, that they
could not be separated, and so, as it were, wished to be
punished for incest. These two were, instead of a bride bed
and magnificent marriage, condemned and shut up in an enduring
and everlasting prison, which, because of their high
birth and goodly state, and also so that in future they should
not be guilty in secret, but all their conduct should be known
to the guard placed over them and in his sight, was made
<pb n="009"/><anchor id="Pg009"/>
quite transparent, bright and clear like a crystal, and round
like a sphere of heaven, and there they were with continual
tears and true contrition to atone and make reparation for
their past misdeeds. [Instead of to a bride bed the two
were brought to a prison, so that their actions could be
watched. The prison was transparent; it was a bright
crystal clear chamber, like a sphere of heaven, corresponding
to the high position of the two persons.] Previously, however,
all their rare clothing and finery that they had put on
for ornament was taken away, so that in such a chamber
they must be quite naked and merely dwell with each other.
[It is not directly understood by these words that a cohabitation
in modern sense (coition) is meant. According to modern
language the passage must be rendered, <q>had to dwell
near each other naked and bare.</q> One is reminded, moreover,
of the nuptial customs that are observed particularly
in the marriage of persons of high birth. In any case and,
in spite of my reservation, what occurs is conducive or designed
to lead to the sexual union.] Besides they gave them
no one that had to go into the chamber to wait on them,
but after they put in all the necessities in the way of meat
and drink, which were created from the afore mentioned
water, the door of the chamber was fast bolted and locked,
the faculty seal impressed on it and I was enjoined that I
should guard them here, and spend the winter before the
door; the chamber should be duly warmed so that they be
neither too hot nor too cold, and they could neither come
out nor escape. But should they, on account of any hope
of breaking this mandate, escape, I would thereupon be
justly subjected to heavy punishment. I was not pleased
by the thing, my fear and solicitude made me faint hearted,
for I communed with myself that it was no small thing that
had befallen me, as I knew also that the college of wisdom
was accustomed not to lie but to put into action what it
<pb n="010"/><anchor id="Pg010"/>
said. Yet because I could not change it, beside which this
locked chamber stood in the center of a strong tower and
surrounded with strong bulwarks and high walls, in which
one could with a small but continuous fire warm the whole
chamber, I undertook this office, and began in God's name
to warm the chamber, and protect the imprisoned pair from
the cold. But what happened? As soon as they perceived
the slightest warmth they embraced each other so tenderly
that the like will not soon be seen, and stayed so hot that
the young bridegroom's heart in his body dissolved for ardent
love, also his whole body almost melted in his beloved's arms
and fell apart. When she who loved him no less than he
did her, saw this, she wept over him passionately and, as it
were buried him with her tears so that one could not see,
for her gushing tears that overflowed everything, where he
went. Her weeping and sorrowing had driven her to this
in a short time, and she would not for deep anguish of heart
live longer, but voluntarily gave herself to death. Ah woe
is me. In what pain and need and trouble was I that my
two charges had quite disappeared in water, and death alone
was left for me. My certain destruction stood before my
eyes, and what was the greatest hardship to me, I feared the
threatened shame and disgrace that would happen to me,
more than the injury that would overtake me.
</p>

<p>
[15]. As I now passed several days in such solitude and
pondered over the question how I could remedy my affairs,
it occurred to me how Medea had revived the dead body of
Aeson, and I thought to myself, <q>If Medea could do such a
thing, why should such a thing fail me?</q> I began at once
to bethink me how I would do it, found however no better
way than that I should persist with continual warmth until
the waters disappeared, and I might see again the corpses of
our lovers. As I hoped to come off without danger and
with great advantage and praise I went on with my warmth
<pb n="011"/><anchor id="Pg011"/>
that I had begun and continued it forty whole days, as I
was aware that the water kept on diminishing the longer I
kept it up, and the corpses that were yet as black as coal,
began again to be visible. And truly this would have occurred
before if the chamber had not been all too securely
locked and bolted. Which I yet did not avail to open. For
I noted particularly that the water that rose and hastened
to the clouds, collected above in the chamber and fell down
like rain, so that nothing could come of it, until our bridegroom
with his dearest bride, dead and rotten, and therefore
hideously stinking, lay before my eyes.
</p>

<p>
All the while the sunshine in the moist weather caused an
exceedingly beautiful rainbow to be seen, in the chamber,
with surprisingly beautiful colors, which overjoyed not a
little my overpowering affliction. Much more was I delighted
that I saw my two lovers lying before me again.
But as no joy is so great but is mixed with much sadness, so
I was troubled in my joy thinking that my charges lay still
dead before me, and one could trace no life in them. But
because I knew that their chamber was made of such pure
and thick material, also so tight-locked that their soul and
spirit could not get out, but was still closely guarded within,
I continued with my steady warmth day and night, to perform
my delegated office, quite impressed with the fact that
the two would not return to their bodies, as long as the
moisture continued. For in the moist state nature keeps
itself the same, as I then also found in fact and in truth.
For I was aware upon careful examination that from the
earth at evening through the power of the sun, many vapors
arose and drew themselves up just as the sun draws water.
They were condensed in the night in a lovely and very
fruitful dew, which very early in the morning fell and
moistened the earth and washed our dead corpses, so that
from day to day, the longer such bathing and washing continued,
<pb n="012"/><anchor id="Pg012"/>
the more beautiful and whiter they became. But
the fairer and whiter they became, the more they lost moisture,
till finally the air being bright and beautiful, and all
the mist and moist weather, having passed, the spirit and
soul of the bride could hold itself no longer in the bright
air, but went back into the clarified and still more transfigured
body of the queen, who soon experienced it [i.e. her
soul and spirit] and at once lived again. This, then, as I
could easily observe, not a little pleased me, especially as I
saw her arise in surpassingly costly garments whose like was
never seen on earth, and with a precious crown decked with
bright diamonds; and also heard her speak. <q>Hear ye children
of men and perceive ye that are born of women, that
the most high power can set up kings and can remove kings.
He makes rich and poor, according to his will. He kills
and makes again to live.</q>
</p>

<p>
[16]. See in me a true and living example of all that.
I was great and became small, but now after having been
humbled, I am a queen elevated over many kingdoms. I
have been killed and made to live. To poor me have been
trusted and given over the great treasures of the sages and
the mighty.
</p>

<p>
[17]. <q>Therefore power is also given me to make the
poor rich, show kindness to the lowly, and bring health
to the sick. But I am not yet like my well-beloved brother,
the great and powerful king, who is still to be awakened
from the dead. When he comes he will prove that my words
are true.</q>
</p>

<p>
[18]. And when she said that the sun shone very bright,
and the day was warmer than before, and the dog days were
at hand. But because, a long time before, there were prepared
for the lordly and great wedding of our new queen
many costly robes, as of black velvet, ashen damask, gray
silk, silver taffeta, snow white satin, even one studded with
<pb n="013"/><anchor id="Pg013"/>
surpassingly beautiful silver pieces and with precious pearls
and lordly bright-gleaming diamonds, so likewise different
garments were arranged and prepared for the young king,
namely of carnation, yellow Auranian colors, precious gear,
and finally a red velvet garment with precious rubies and
thickly incrusted with carbuncles. But the tailors that made
their clothes were quite invisible, so that I also wondered
as I saw one coat prepared after another and one garment
after another, how these things came to pass, since I well
knew that no one came into the chamber except the bridegroom
with his bride. So that what I wondered at most of
all was that as soon as another coat or garment was ready,
the first immediately vanished before my eyes, so that I knew
not whence they came or who had taken them away.
</p>

<p>
[19]. When now this precious clothing was ready, the
great and mighty king appeared in great splendor and magnificence,
to which nothing might be compared. And when
he found himself shut in, he begged me with friendly and
very gracious words, to open the door for him and permit
him to go out; it would prove of great advantage to me.
Although I was strictly forbidden to open the chamber, yet
the grand appearance and the winning persuasiveness of the
king disconcerted me so that I cheerfully let him go. And
when he went out he was so friendly and so gracious and
yet so meek that he proved indeed that nothing did so grace
high persons as did these virtues.
</p>

<p>
[20]. But because he had passed the dog days in great
heat, he was very thirsty, also faint and tired and directed
me to dip up some of the swift running water under the
mill wheels, and bring it, and when I did, he drank a large
part with great eagerness, went back into his chamber, and
bade me close the door fast behind him, so that no one might
disturb him or wake him from sleep.
</p>

<p>
[21]. Here he rested for a few days and called to me to
<pb n="014"/><anchor id="Pg014"/>
open the door. Methought, however, that he was much
more beautiful, more ruddy and lordly, which he then also
remarked and deemed it a lordly and wholesome water,
drank much of it, more than before so that I was resolved to
build the chamber much larger. [Evidently because the inmate
increased in size.] When now the king had drunk to
his satisfaction of this precious drink, which yet the unknowing
regard as nothing he became so beautiful and lordly,
that in my whole life I never saw a more lordly person nor
more lordly demeanor. Then he led me into his kingdom,
and showed me all the treasures and riches of the world, so
that I must confess, that not only had the queen announced
the truth, but also had omitted to describe the greater part
of it as it seemed to those that know it. For there was no
end of gold and noble carbuncle there; rejuvenation and
restoration of natural forces, and also recovery of lost health,
and removal of all diseases were a common thing in that
place. The most precious of all was that the people of that
land knew their creator, feared and honored him, and asked
of him wisdom and understanding, and finally after this
transitory glory an everlasting blessedness. To that end
help us God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

The author of the preceding narrative calls it a
parable. Its significance may have indeed appeared
quite transparent to him, and he presupposes
that the readers of his day knew what form of
learning he masked in it. The story impresses us
as rather a fairy story or a picturesque dream. If
we compare parables that come nearer to our modern
point of view and are easily understood on account
of their simplicity, like those of Ruckert or
those of the New Testament, the difference can be
<pb n="015"/><anchor id="Pg015"/>
clearly seen. The unnamed author evidently pursues
a definite aim; one does find some unity in the
bizarre confusion of his ideas; but what he is aiming
at and what he wishes to tell us with his images we
cannot immediately conceive. The main fact for us
is that the anonymous writer speaks in a language
that shows decided affinity with that of dreams and
myths. Therefore, however we may explain in
what follows the peculiarly visionary character of
the parable, we feel compelled to examine it with
the help of a psychological method, which, endeavoring
to get from the surface to the depths, will be
able to trace analytically the formative powers of
the dream life and allied phenomena, and explain
their mysterious symbols.
</p>

<p>
I have still to reveal in what book and in what
circumstances the parable appears. It is in the second
volume of a book <q>Geheime Figuren der Rosenkreuzer
aus dem 16ten und 17ten Jahrhundert,</q>
published at Altona about 1785-90. Its chief
contents are large plates with pictorial representations
and with them a number of pages of text.
According to a note on the title page, the contents
are <q>for the first time brought to light from an old
manuscript.</q> The parable is in the second volume
of a three-volume series which bears the subtitle:
Ein güldener Tractat vom philosophischen Steine.
Von einem noch lebenden, doch ungenannten Philosopho,
den Filiis doctrinae zur Lehre, den Fratribus
Aureae Crucis aber zur Nachrichtung beschrieben.
Anno, M.D.C.XXV.
</p>

<pb n="016"/><anchor id="Pg016"/>

<p>
If I add that this book is an hermetic treatise
(alchemistic), it may furnish a general classification
for it, but will hardly give any definite idea of its
nature, not merely on account of the oblivion into
which this kind of writing has now fallen, but also
because the few ideas usually connected with it produce
a distorted picture. The hermetic art, as it is
treated here, the principles of which strike us to-day
as fantastic, is related to several <q>secret</q> sciences
and organizations, some of which have been discredited:
magic, kabbala, rosicrucianism, etc. It is
particularly closely connected with alchemy so that
the terms <q>hermetic art</q> and <q>alchemy</q> (and
even <q>royal art</q>) are often used synonymously.
This <q>art</q>&mdash;to call it by the name that not without
some justification it applies to itself&mdash;leads us
by virtue of its many ramifications into a large number
of provinces, which furnish us desirable material
for our research.
</p>

<p>
So I will first, purposely advancing on one line,
regard the parable as a dream or a fairy tale and
analyze it psychoanalytically. This treatment will,
for the information of the reader, be preceded by a
short exposition of psychoanalysis as a method of
interpretation of dreams and fairy tales. Then I
will, still seeking for the roots of the matter, introduce
the doctrines that the pictorial language of the
parable symbolizes. I will give consideration to the
chemical viewpoint of alchemy and also the hermetic
philosophy and its hieroglyphic educational methods.
</p>

<p>
Connections will be developed with religious and
<pb n="017"/><anchor id="Pg017"/>
ethical topics, and we shall have to take into account
the historical and psychological relations of hermetic
thought with rosicrucianism in its various forms, and
freemasonry. And when we begin, at the conclusion
of the analytical section of my work, to apply to the
solution of our parable and of several folk tales the
insight we have gained, we shall be confronted with
a problem in which we shall face two apparently contradictory
interpretations, according to whether we
follow the lead of psychoanalysis or of the hermetic,
hieroglyphic solution. The question will then arise
whether and how the contradiction occurs. How
shall we bring into relation with each other and reconcile
the two different interpretations which are quite
different and complete in themselves?
</p>

<p>
The question arising from the several illustrations
expands into a general problem, to which the synthetic
part of my book is devoted. This will, among
other considerations, lead us into the psychology of
symbol-making where again the discoveries of psychoanalysis
come to our aid. We shall not be satisfied
with analysis, but endeavor to follow up certain
evolutionary tendencies which, expressed in psychological
symbols, developing according to natural
laws, will allow us to conjecture a spiritual building
up or progression that one might call an anabasis.
We shall see plainly by this method of study how
the original contradiction arises and how what was
previously irreconcilable, turns out to be two poles
of an evolutionary process. By that means, several
principles of myth interpretation will be derived.
</p>

<pb n="018"/><anchor id="Pg018"/>

<p>
I have just spoken of an anabasis. By that we
are to understand a forward movement in a moral
or religious sense. The most intensive exemplar
of the anabasis (whatever this may be) is mysticism.
I can but grope about in the psychology of mysticism;
I trust I may have more confidence at that point
where I look at its symbolism from the ethical point
of view.

<head>Dream And Myth Interpretation.</head>

<p>
[Readers versed in Freud's psychoanalysis are
requested to pass over this chapter as they will find
only familiar matter.]
</p>

<p>
In the narrative which we have just examined its
dream-like character is quite noticeable. On what
does it depend? Evidently the Parable must bear
marks that are peculiar to the dream. In looking
for correspondences we discover them even upon
superficial examination.
</p>

<p>
Most noticeable is the complete and sudden
change of place. The wanderer, as I will hereafter
call the narrator of the parable, sees himself immediately
transported from the place near the lion's
den to the top of a wall, and does not know how he
has come there. Later he comes down just as suddenly.
And in still other parts of the story there
occurs just as rapid changes of scene as one is accustomed
to in dreams. Characteristic also is the
fact that objects change or vanish; the shift of scene
resembles also, as often in a dream, a complete transformation.
Thus, for instance, as soon as the wanderer
has left the wall, it vanishes without leaving a
trace, as if it had never been. A similar change is
also required in the garden scene where, instead of
<pb n="020"/><anchor id="Pg020"/>
the previously observed enclosing-wall, a low hedge
appears in a surprising manner.
</p>

<p>
Further, we are surprised by instances of knowledge
without perception. Often in a dream one
knows something without having experienced it in
person. We simply know, without knowing how,
that in such a house something definite and full of
mystery has happened; or we know that this man,
whom we see now for the first time, is called so and
so; we are in some place for the first time but know
quite surely that there must be a fountain behind that
wall to which for any reason we have to go, etc.
Such unmediated knowledge occurs several times in
the parable. In the beginning of the narrative the
wanderer, although a stranger, knows that the lovely
meadow is called by its inhabitants Pratum felicitatis.
He knows intuitively the name of one of the men unknown
to him. In the garden scene he knows, although
he has noticed only the young men, that some
young women (whom on account of the nature of
the place he cannot then see) are desirous of going
into the garden to these young men. One might say
that all this is merely a peculiarity of the representation
inasmuch as the author has for convenience,
or on account of lack of skill, or for brevity, left
out some connecting link which would have afforded
us the means of acquiring this unexplained knowledge.
The likeness to the dream therefore would
in that case be inadmissible. To this objection it
may be replied, that the dream does exactly like the
author of the parable. Our study is chiefly concerned
<pb n="021"/><anchor id="Pg021"/>
with the product of the fancy and forces us
to the observation (whatever may be the cause of it)
that the parable and the dream life have certain <q>peculiarities
of representation</q> in common.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the miraculous knowledge we find
in the dream a peculiar unsureness in many things,
particularly in those which concern the personality of
the wanderer. When the elders inform the wanderer
that he must marry the woman that he has
taken, he does not know clearly whether the matter
at all concerns him or not; a remarkable fluctuation
in his attitude takes place. We wonder
whether he has taken on the rôle of the bridegroom
or, quite the reverse, the bridegroom has taken the
wanderer's. We are likewise struck by similar uncertainties,
like those during the walk on top of the
wall where the wanderer is followed by some one,
of whom he does not know whether it is a man or a
woman. Here belong also those passages of the
narrative introduced by the wanderer with <q>as if,</q>
etc. In the search for the gardener's house he
chances upon many people and <q>it seems</q> that he
has himself done what these people are there doing.
</p>

<p>
Quite characteristic also are the different obstructions
and other difficulties placed in the path of the
wanderer. Even in the first paragraph of the narrative
we hear that he is startled, would gladly turn
back, but cannot because a strong wind prevents him.
On top of the wall the railing makes his progress
difficult; on other occasions a wall, or a door. The
first experience, especially, recalls those frequent occurrences
<pb n="022"/><anchor id="Pg022"/>
in dreams where, anxiously turning in
flight or oppressed by tormenting haste, we cannot
move. In connection with what is distressing and
threatening, as described in the precipitous slope of
the wall and the narrow plank by the mill, belong
also the desperate tasks and demands&mdash;quite usual
in dreams and myths&mdash;that meet the wanderer.
Among such tasks or dangers I will only mention
the severe examination by the elders, the struggle
with the lion, the obligation to marry, and the burden
of responsibility for the nuptial pair, all of which
cause the wanderer so much anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Among the evident dream analogies belongs finally
(without, however, completing my list of them) the
peculiar logic that appears quite conventional to the
wanderer or the dreamer, but seldom satisfies the
reader or the careful reasoner. As examples, I
mention that the dead lion will be called to life
again if the wanderer marries the woman that he
recently took; and that they put the two lovers that
they want to punish for incest, after they have carefully
removed all the clothes from their bodies, into
a prison where these lovingly embrace.
</p>

<p>
So much for the external resemblances of the
parable with the dream life. The deeper affinity
which can be shown in its innermost structure will
first appear in the psychoanalytic treatment. And
now it will be advisable for me to give readers not
intimately acquainted with dream psychology some
information concerning modern investigations in
dream life and in particular concerning psychoanalytic
<pb n="023"/><anchor id="Pg023"/>
doctrines and discoveries. Naturally I can do
this only in the briefest manner. For a more thorough
study I must refer the reader to the work of
Freud and his school. The most important books
are mentioned in the bibliography at the end.
</p>

<p>
Modern scientific investigation of dreams, in
which Freud has been a pioneer, has come to the
conclusion, but in a different sense from the popular
belief, that dreams have a significance. While the
popular belief says that they foretell something of
the future, science shows that they have a meaning
that is present in the psyche and determined by the
past. Dreams are then, as Freud's results show,
always wish phantasies. [I give here only exposition,
not criticism. My later application of psychoanalysis
will show what reservations I make concerning
Freud's doctrines.] In them wishes, strivings,
impulses work themselves out, rising to the surface
from the depths of the soul. When they come in
waking life, wish phantasies are sometimes called
castles in the air. In dreams we have the fulfillment
of wishes that are not or cannot be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
But the impulses that the dreams call up are principally
such wishes and impulses as we cannot ourselves
acknowledge and such as in a waking state we
reject as soon as they attempt to announce themselves,
as for instance, animal tendencies or such
sexual desires as we are unwilling to admit, and also
suppressed or <q>repressed</q> impulses. As a result
of being repressed they have the peculiarity of being
in general inaccessible to consciousness. [Freud
<pb n="024"/><anchor id="Pg024"/>
speaks particularly of crassly egoistic actuations.
The criminal element in them is emphasized by
Stekel.]
</p>

<p>
One not initiated into dream analysis may object
that the obvious evidence is against this theory.
For the majority of dreams picture quite inoffensive
processes that have nothing to do with impulses and
passions which are worthy of rejection on either
moral or other grounds. The objection appears at
first sight to be well founded, but collapses as soon as
we learn that the critical power of morality, which
does not desert us by day, retains by night a part of
its power; and that therefore the fugitive impulses
and tendencies that seek the darkness and dare not
come forth by day, dare not even at night unveil their
true aspect but have to approach, as it were, in costumes,
or disguised as symbols or allegories, in order
to pass unchallenged. The superintending power,
that I just now called the power of morality, is compared
very pertinently to a censor. What our
psyche produces is, so to speak, subjected to a censor
before it is allowed to emerge into the light of consciousness.
And if the fugitive elements want to
venture forth they must be correspondingly disguised,
in order to pass the censor. Freud calls this
disguising or paraphrasing process the dream disfigurement.
The literal is thereby displaced by the
figurative, an allusion intimated through a nebulous
atmosphere. Thus, in the following example, an
unconscious death wish is exhibited. In the examination
of a lady's dream it struck me that the motive
<pb n="025"/><anchor id="Pg025"/>
of a dead child occurred repeatedly, generally in connection
with picnics. During an analysis the lady
observed that when she was a girl the children, her
younger brothers and sisters, were often the obstacles
when it was proposed to have a party or celebration
or the like. The association Kinder
(= children) Hinderniss (= obstacle) furnished
the key to a solution of the stereotyped dream motive.
As further indications showed, it concerned
the children of a married man whom she loved.
The children prevented the man separating from his
wife in order to marry the lady. In waking life she
would not, of course, admit a wish for the death of
the embarrassing children, but in dreams the wish
broke through and represented the secretly wished
situation. The children are dead and nothing now
stands in the way of the <q>party</q> or the celebration
(wedding). The double sense of the word
<q>party</q> is noticeable. (In German <q>eine Partie
machen</q> means both to go on an excursion and to
make a matrimonial match.) Such puns are readily
made use of by dreams, in order to make the objectionable
appear unobjectionable and so to get by
the censor.
</p>

<p>
Psychoanalytic procedure, employed in the interpretation
of dreams of any person can be called a
scientifically organized confession that traces out
with infinite patience even to the smallest ramifications,
the spiritual inventory of what was tucked
away in the mind of the person undergoing it.
Psychoanalysis is used in medical practice to discover
<pb n="026"/><anchor id="Pg026"/>
and relieve the spiritual causes of neurotic phenomena.
The patient is induced to tell more and
more, starting from a given point, thereby going
into the most intimate details, and yet we are aware,
in the network of outcropping thoughts and memories,
of certain points of connection, which have
dominating significance for the affective life of the
person being studied. Here the path begins to be
hard because it leads into the intimately personal.
The secret places of the soul set up a powerful opposition
to the intruder, even without the purposive
action of the patient. Right there are, however, so
to speak, the sore spots (pathogenic <q>complexes</q>)
of the psyche, towards which the research is directed.
Firmly advancing in spite of the limitations, we lay
bare these roots of the soul that strive to cling to
the unconscious. Those are the disfigured elements
just mentioned; all of the items of the spiritual
inventory from which the person in question has toilsomely
<q>worked himself out</q> and from which he
supposes himself free. They must be silent because
they stand in some contradictory relation to the character
in which the person has clothed himself; and
if they, the subterranean elements still try to announce
themselves, he hurls them back immediately
into their underworld; he allows himself to think of
nothing that offends too much his attitudes, his
morality and his feelings. He does not give verbal
expression to the disturbers of the peace that dwell
in his heart of hearts.
</p>

<p>
The mischief makers are, however, merely repressed,
<pb n="027"/><anchor id="Pg027"/>
not dead. They are like the Titans [On
this similarity rests the psychologic term <q>titanic,</q>
used frequently by me in what follows.] which were
not crushed by the gods of Olympus, but only shut
up in the depths of Tartarus. There they wait for
the time when they can again arise and show their
faces in daylight. The earth trembles at their attempts
to free themselves. Thus the titanic forces
of the soul strive powerfully upward. And as they
may not live in the light of consciousness they rave
in darkness. They take the main part in the procreation
of dreams, produce in some cases hysterical
symptoms, compulsion ideas and acts, anxiety neuroses,
etc. The examination of these psychic disturbances
is not without importance for our later
researches.
</p>

<p>
Psychoanalysis, which has not at any time been
limited to medical practice, but soon began with its
torch to illumine the activity of the human spirit in
all its forms (poetry, myth-making, etc.), was decried
as pernicious in many quarters. [The question
as to how widely psychoanalysis may be employed
would at this time lead us too far, yet it will
be considered in Sect. 1, of the synthetic part of this
volume.] Now it is indeed true that it leads us
toward all kinds of spiritual refuse. It does so,
however, in the service of truth, and it would be unfortunate
to deny to truth its right to justify itself.
Any one determined to do so could in that case defend
a theory that sexual maladies are acquired by
catching a cold.
</p>

<pb n="028"/><anchor id="Pg028"/>

<p>
The spiritual refuse that psychoanalysis uncovers
is like the manure on which our cultivated fruits
thrive. The dark titanic impulses are the raw material
from which in every man, the work of civilization
forms an ethical character. Where there is a
strong light there are deep shadows. Should we be
so insincere as to deny, because of supposed danger,
the shadows in our inmost selves? Do we not diminish
the light by so doing? Morality, in whose
name we are so scrupulous, demands above everything
else, truth and sincerity. But the beginning
of all truth is that we do not impose upon ourselves.
<q>Know thyself</q> is written over the entrance of the
Pythian sanctuary. And it is this inspiring summons
of the radiant god of Delphi that psychoanalysis
seeks to meet.
</p>

<p>
After this introductory notice, it will be possible
properly to understand the following instructive
example, which contains exquisite sexual symbolism.
</p>

<p>
Dream of Mr. T. <q>I dreamed I was riding on
the railroad. Near me sat a delicate, effeminate
young man or boy; his presence caused erotic feelings
in me to a certain extent. (It appeared as if I
put my arm about him.) The train came to a standstill;
we had arrived at a station and got out. I
went with the boy into a valley through which ran
a small brook, on whose bank were strawberries.
We picked a great many. After I had gathered a
large number I returned to the railway and awoke.</q>
</p>

<pb n="029"/><anchor id="Pg029"/>

<p>
Supplementary communication. <q>I think I remember
that an uncomfortable feeling came over me
in the boy's company. The valley branched off to
the left from the railway.</q>
</p>

<p>
From a discussion of the dream it next appeared
that T., who, as far as I knew, entertained a pronounced
aversion to homosexuality, had read a short
time before a detailed account of a notorious trial
then going on in Germany, that was concerned with
real homosexual actions. [In consciousness, of
course. In the suppressed depths of unconsciousness
the infantile homosexual component also will surely
be found.] An incident from it, probably supported
by some unconscious impulse, crowded its way into
the dream as an erotic wish, hence the affectionate
scene in the railway train. So far the matter would
be intelligible even if in an erotic day dream the
image of a boy, considering the existing sexual tendency
of T., had been resolutely rejected by him.
How are the other processes in the dream related
to it? Do they not at first sight appear unconnected
or meaningless?
</p>

<p>
And yet in them are manifested the fulfillment of
the wish implied in the erotic excitement in the company
of the boy. The homosexual action of this
wish fulfillment would have been insufferable to the
dream censor; it must be intimated symbolically.
And the remainder of the dream is accordingly nothing
but a dextrous veiling of a procedure hostile to
the censor.
</p>

<pb n="030"/><anchor id="Pg030"/>

<p>
Even that the train comes to a standstill is a polite
paraphrase. [Paraphrase as the dreamer communicated
to me, of an actual physical condition&mdash;an
erection.] Similar meaning is conveyed by the
word station, which reminds us of the Latin word
status (from stare, to stand). The scene in the
car recalls moreover the joke in a story which often
used to occur to T. <q>A lady invited to a reception,
where there were also young girls, a <hi rend='italic'>Hungarian</hi>
[accentuated now, on account of what follows] (the
typical Vienna joker), who is feared on account of
his racy wit. She enjoined him at the same time,
in view of the presence of the girls, not to treat them
to any of his spicy jests. The Hungarian agreed
and appeared at the party. To the amazement of
the lady, he proposed the following riddle: <q>'One
can enter from in front, or from behind, only one
has to stand up.</q> Observing the despair of the lady,
he, with a sly, innocent look, said, <q>But well then,
what is it? Simply a trolley car.</q> Next day the
daughter of the house appeared before her schoolmates
in the high school with the following:<q>'Girls,
I heard a great joke yesterday; one can go in from
in front or behind, only one must be stiff.</q></q> [A
neat contribution, by the way, to the psychology of
innocent girlhood.] The anecdote was related to
T. by a man later known to him as a homosexual.
T. had been with few Hungarians, but with these
few, homosexuality had been, as it happened, a favorite
subject of conversation.
</p>

<p>
In the above we find many highly suggestive elements.
<pb n="031"/><anchor id="Pg031"/>
The most suggestive is, however, the strawberries.
T. had, as appeared during the process of
the analysis, a couple of days before the dream
read a French story where the expression (new to
him) <hi rend='italic'>cueillir des fraises</hi> occurred. He went to a
Frenchman for the explanation of this phrase and
learned that it was a delicate way of speaking of
the sexual act, because lovers like to go into the
woods under the pretext of picking strawberries,
and thus separate themselves from the rest of the
company. In whatever way the dream wish conceived
its gratification, the valley (between the two
hills!) through which the brook flowed furnishes
a quite definite suggestion. Here also the above
mentioned <q>from behind</q> probably gets a meaning.
</p>

<p>
The circumstance that the dream has, as it were,
two faces, with one that it openly exposes to view,
implies that a distinction must be made between the
manifest and the latent material. The openly exposed
face is the manifest dream content (as the
wording of the dream report represents the dream);
what is concealed is the latent dream thoughts. For
the most part a broad tissue of dream thoughts is
condensed into a dream. A part of the dream
thoughts (not all) belongs regularly to the titanic
elements of our psyche. The shaping of the dream
out of the dream thoughts is called by Freud the
dream work. Four principles direct it, Condensation,
Displacement, Representability, and Secondary
Elaboration.
</p>

<pb n="032"/><anchor id="Pg032"/>

<p>
Condensation was just now mentioned. Many
dream thoughts are condensed to relatively few, but
therefore all the more significant, images. Every
image (person, object, etc.) is wont to be <q>determined</q>
by several dream thoughts. Hence we
speak of multiple determination or <q>Overdetermination.</q>
</p>

<p>
Displacement shows itself in the fact that the
dream (evidently in the service of distortion) pushes
forward the unreal and pushes aside the real; in
short, rearranges the psychic values (interest) in
such a way that the dream in comparison with its
latent thoughts appears as it were displaced or
<q>elsewhere centered.</q>
</p>

<p>
As the dream is a perceptual representation it
must put into perceptually comprehensible form
everything that it wants to express, even that which
is most abstract. The tendency to vividly perceptual
or plastic expression that is characteristic of
the dream, corresponds accordingly to the Representability.
</p>

<p>
To the Secondary Elaboration we have to credit
the last polishing of the dream fabric. It looks
after the logical connection in the pictorial material,
which is created by the displacing dream work.
<q>This function (i.e., the secondary elaboration)
proceeds after the manner which the poet maliciously
ascribes to the philosopher; with its shreds and
patches it stops the gaps in the structure of the
dream. The result of its effort is that the dream
loses its appearance of absurdity and disconnectedness
<pb n="033"/><anchor id="Pg033"/>
and approaches the standard of a comprehensible
experience. But the effort is not always crowned
with complete success.</q> (Freud, <q>Traumdeutung,</q>
p. 330.) The secondary elaboration can be
compared also to the erection of a façade.
</p>

<p>
Of the entire dreamwork Freud says (<q>Traumdeutung,</q>
p. 338) comprehensively that it is <q>not
merely more careless, more incorrect, more easily
forgotten or more fragmentary than waking
thought; it is something qualitatively quite different
and therefore not in the least comparable with it.
It does not, in fact, think, reckon, or judge, but limits
itself to remodeling. It may be exhaustively described
if we keep in view the conditions which its
productions have to satisfy. These productions, the
dream, will have first of all to avoid the censor, and
for this purpose the dream work resorts to displacement
of psychic intensities even to the point of changing
all psychic values; thoughts must be exclusively
or predominantly given in the material of visual and
auditory memory images, and from this grows that
demand for representability which it answers with
new displacements. Greater intensities must apparently
be attained here, than are at its disposal in
dream thoughts at night, and this purpose is served
by the extreme condensation which affects the elements
of the dream thoughts. There is little regard
for the logical relations of the thought material; they
find finally an indirect representation in formal peculiarities
of dreams. The affects of dream
thoughts suffer slighter changes than their image
<pb n="034"/><anchor id="Pg034"/>
content. They are usually repressed. Where they
are retained they are detached from images and
grouped according to their similarity.</q>
</p>

<p>
Briefly to express the nature of the dream, Stekel
gives in one place (<q>Sprache des Traumes,</q> p. 107)
this concise characterization: <q>The dream is a
play of images in the service of the affects.</q>
</p>

<p>
A nearly exact formula for the dream has been
contributed by Freud and Rank, <q>On the foundation
and with the help of repressed infantile sexual
material, the dream regularly represents as fulfilled
actual wishes and usually also erotic wishes in disguised
and symbolically veiled form.</q> (Jb.; ps. F.,
p. 519, and Trdtg., p. 117.) In this formula the
wish fulfillment, following Freud's view, is preponderant,
yet it would appear to me that it is given too
exclusive a rôle in the (chiefly affective) background
of the dream. An important point is the infantile in
the dream, in which connection we must mention
the Regression.
</p>

<p>
Regression is a kind of psychic retrogression that
takes place in manifold ways in the dream (and
related psychic events). The dream reaches back
towards infantile memories and wishes. [Sometimes
this is already recognizable in the manifest
dream content. Usually, however, it is first disclosed
by psychoanalysis. Strongly repressed, and
therefore difficult of access, is this infantile sexual
material. On the infantile forms of sexuality, see
Freud, <q>Three Contributions to Sexual Theory.</q>]
It reaches back also from the complicated and completed
<pb n="035"/><anchor id="Pg035"/>
to a more primitive function, from abstract
thought to perceptual images, from practical activity
to hallucinatory wish fulfillment. [The latter
with especial significance in the convenience dreams.
We fall asleep, for instance, when thirsty, then instead
of reaching for the glass of water, we dream
of the drink.] The dreamer thus approaches his
own childhood, as he does likewise the childhood of
the human race, by reaching back for the more primitive
perceptual mode of thought. [On the second
kind of regression the Zurich psychiatrist, C. G.
Jung, has made extraordinary interesting revelations.
His writings will further occupy our attention
later.]
</p>

<p>
Nietzsche writes (<q>Menschliches, Allzumenschliches</q>),
<q>In sleep and in dreams we pass through
the entire curriculum of primitive mankind.... I
mean as even to-day we think in dreams, mankind
thought in waking life through many thousand years;
the first cause that struck his spirit in order to explain
anything that needed explanation satisfied him
and passed as truth. In dreams this piece of ancient
humanity works on in us, for it is the germ
from which the higher reason developed and in
every man still develops. The dream takes us back
into remote conditions of human culture and puts in
our hand the means of understanding it better. The
dream thought is now so easy because, during the
enormous duration of the evolution of mankind we
have been so well trained in just this form of cheap,
phantastic explanation by the first agreeable fancy.
<pb n="036"/><anchor id="Pg036"/>
In that respect the dream is a means of recovery for
the brain, which by day has to satisfy the strenuous
demands of thought required by the higher culture.</q>
(Works, Vol. II, pp. 27 ff.)
</p>

<p>
If we remember that the explanation of nature
and the philosophizing of unschooled humanity is
consummated in the form of myths, we can deduce
from the preceding an analogy between myth making
and dreaming. This analogy is much further developed
by psychoanalysis. Freud blazes a path
with the following words: <q>The research into
these concepts of folk psychology [myths, sagas,
fairy stories] is at present not by any means concluded,
but it is apparent everywhere from myths,
for instance, that they correspond to the displaced
residues of wish phantasies of entire nations, the
dreams of ages of young humanity.</q> (Samml. kl.
Lehr. II, p. 205.) It will be shown later that fairy
stories and myths can actually be subjected to the
same psychologic interpretation as dreams, that for
the most part they rest on the same psychological
motives (suppressed wishes, that are common to all
men) and that they show a similar structure to that
of dreams.
</p>

<p>
Abraham (Traum und Mythus)<note place='foot'>See Translations in the Nervous and
Mental Disease Monograph Series for this and the other studies cited in this
section.</note> has gone farther
in developing the parallelism of dream and
myth. For him the myth is the dream of a people
and a dream is the myth of the individual. He says,
e.g., <q>The dream is (according to Freud) a piece
<pb n="037"/><anchor id="Pg037"/>
of superseded infantile, mental life</q> and <q>the myth
is a piece of superseded infantile, mental life of a
people</q>; also, <q>The dream then, is the myth of the
individual.</q> Rank conceives the myths as images
intermediate between collective dreams and collective
poems. <q>For as in the individual the dream
or poem is destined to draw off unconscious emotions
that are repressed in the course of the evolution of
civilization, so in mythical or religious phantasies a
whole people liberates itself for the maintenance of
its psychic soundness from those primal impulses
that are refractory to culture (titanic), while at the
same time it creates, as it were, a collective symptom
for taking up all repressed emotion.</q> (Inz-Mot.,
p. 277. Cf. also Kunstl., p. 36.)
</p>

<p>
A definite group of such repressed primal impulses
is given a prominent place by psychoanalysis. I
refer to the so-called Œdipus complex that plays
an important rôle in the dream life as also in myth
and apparently, also in creative poetry. The fables
(sagas, dramas) of Œdipus, who slays his father
and marries his mother are well known. According
to the observations of psychoanalysis there is a
bit of Œdipus in every one of us. [These Œdipus
elements in us can&mdash;as I must observe after reading
Imago, January, 1913&mdash;be called <q>titanic</q>
in the narrower sense, following the lead of Lorenz.
They contain the motive for the separation of the
child from the parents.] The related conflicts, that
in their entirety constitute the Œdipus complex (almost
always unconscious, because actively repressed)
<pb n="038"/><anchor id="Pg038"/>
arise in the disturbance of the relation to
the parents which every child goes through more
or less in its first (and very early) sexual emotions.
<q rend='pre'>If king Œdipus can deeply affect modern mankind
no less than the contemporary Greeks, the explanation
can lie only in the fact that the effect of
the Greek tragedy does not depend on the antithesis
between fate and the human will, but in the peculiarity
of the material in which this antithesis is
developed. There must be a voice in our inner life
which is ready to recognize the compelling power of
fate in the case of Œdipus, while we reject as arbitrary
the situations in the Ahnfrau or other destiny
tragedies. And such an element is indeed contained
in the history of king Œdipus. His fate touches
us only because it might have been ours, because the
oracle hung the same curse over us before our birth
as over him. For us all, probably, it is ordained
that we should direct our first sexual feelings towards
our mothers, the first hate and wish for violence
against our fathers. Our dreams convince us
of that. King Œdipus, who has slain his father
Laius and married his mother Jocasta, is only the
wish-fulfillment of our childhood. But more fortunate
than he, we have been able, unless we have
become psychoneurotic, to dissociate our sexual feelings
from our mothers and forget our jealousy of
our fathers. From the person in whom that childish
wish has been fulfilled we recoil with the entire
force of the repressions, that these wishes have since
that time suffered in our inner soul. While the poet
<pb n="039"/><anchor id="Pg039"/>
in his probing brings to light the guilt of Œdipus,
he calls to our attention our own inner life, in which
that impulse, though repressed, is always present.
The antithesis with which the chorus leaves us</q>

<p>
<q rend='post'>This admonition hits us and our pride, we who have

and after their disclosure we should all like to turn
away our gaze from the scenes of our childhood.</q>

the reader who was unfamiliar with psychoanalysis
for the psychoanalytic part of my investigation,
I will dispense with further time-consuming

<head>Psychoanalytic Interpretation Of The Parable.</head>

<p>
Although we know that the parable was written
by a follower of the hermetic art, and apparently
for the purpose of instruction, we shall proceed, with
due consideration, to pass over the hermetic content
of the narrative, which will later be investigated,
and regard it only as a play of free fantasy. We
shall endeavor to apply to the parable knowledge
gained from the psychoanalytic interpretation of
dreams, and we shall find that the parable, as a creation
of the imagination, shows at the very foundations
the same structure as dreams. I repeat emphatically
that in this research, in being guided
merely by the psychoanalytic point of view, we are
for the time being proceeding in a decidedly one-sided
manner.
</p>

<p>
In the interpretation of the parable we cannot
apply the original method of psychoanalysis. This
consists in having a series of seances with the
dreamer in order to evoke the free associations.
The dreamer of the parable&mdash;or rather the author&mdash;has
long ago departed this life. We are
obliged then to give up the preparatory process and
<pb n="044"/><anchor id="Pg044"/>
stick to the methods derived from them. There are
three such methods.
</p>

<p>
The first is the comparison with typical dream
images. It has been shown that in the dreams of
all individuals certain phases and types continually
recur, and in its symbolism have a far reaching general
validity, because they are manifestly built on
universal human emotions. Their imaginative expression
is created according to a psychical law
which remains fairly unaffected by individual differences.
</p>

<p>
The second is the parallel from folk psychology.
The inner affinity of dream and myth implies that
for the interpretation of individual creations of
fancy, parallels can profitably be drawn from the
productions of the popular imagination and vice
versa.
</p>

<p>
The third is the conclusions from the peculiarities
of structure of the dream (myth, fairy tale) itself.
In dreams and still more significantly in the more
widely cast works of the imagination creating in a
dream-like manner, as e.g., in myths and fairy tales,
one generally finds motives that are several times
repeated in similar stories even though with variations
and with different degrees of distinctness.
[Let this not be misunderstood. I do not wish to
revive the exploded notion that myths are merely
the play of a fancy that requires occupation. My
position on the interpretation of myths will be explained
in Part I. of the synthetic part.] It is
then possible by the comparison of individual instances
<pb n="045"/><anchor id="Pg045"/>
of a motive, to conclude concerning its true
character, inasmuch as one, as it were, completes in
accordance with their original tendency the lines of
increasing distinctness in the different examples, and
thus&mdash;to continue the geometric metaphor&mdash;one
obtains in their prolongations a point of intersection
in which can be recognized the goal of the process
toward which the dream strives, a goal, however,
that is not found in the dream itself but only in the
interpretation.
</p>

<p>
We shall employ the three methods of interpretation
conjointly. After all we shall proceed exactly
as psychoanalysis does in interpretation of folk-lore.
For in this also there are no living authors
that we can call and question. We have succeeded
well enough, however, with the derived methods.
The lack of an actual living person will be compensated
for in a certain sense by the ever living folk
spirit and the infinite series of its manifestations
(folk-lore, etc.). The results of this research will
help us naturally in the examination of our parable,
except in so far as I must treat some of the conclusions
of psychoanalysis with reserve as problematic.
</p>

<p>
Let us now turn to the parable. Let us follow
the author, or as I shall call him, the wanderer, into
his forest, where he meets his extraordinary adventures.
</p>

<p>
I have just used a figure, <q>Let us follow him into
his forest.</q> This is worthy of notice. I mean, of
course, that we betake ourselves into his world of
imagination and live through his dreams with him.
<pb n="046"/><anchor id="Pg046"/>
We leave the paths of everyday life, in order to
rove in the jungle of phantasy. If we remember
rightly, the wanderer used the same metaphor at the
beginning of his narrative. He comes upon a
thicket in the woods, loses the usual path.... He,
too, speaks figuratively. Have we almost unaware,
in making his symbolism our own, partially drawn
away the veil from his mystery? It is a fact confirmed
by many observations [Cf. my works on
threshold symbolism&mdash;Schwellensymbolik, Jahrb.
ps. F. III, p. 621 ff., IV, p. 675 ff.] that in hypnagogic
hallucinations (dreamy images before going
to sleep), besides all kinds of thought material, the
state of going to sleep also portrays itself in exactly
the same way that in the close of a dream or hypnotic
illusions on awakening, the act of awakening
is pictorially presented. The symbolism of awakening
brings indeed pictures of leave taking, departing,
opening of a door, sinking, going free out of a dark
surrounding, coming home, etc. The pictures for
going to sleep are sinking, entering into a room, a
garden or a dark forest.
</p>

<p>
The fairy story also used the same forest symbol.
Whether on sinking into sleep I have the sensation
of going into a dark forest or whether the hero of
the story goes into a forest (which to be sure has
still other interpretations), or whether the wanderer
in the parable gets into a tangle of underbrush, all
amounts to the same thing; it is always the introduction
into a life of phantasy, the entrance into the
theater of the dream. The wanderer, if he had not
<pb n="047"/><anchor id="Pg047"/>
chosen for his fairy tale the first person, could have
begun as follows: There was once a king whose
greatest joy was in the chase. Once as he was drawn
with his companions into a great forest, and was
pursuing a fleet stag, he was separated from his followers,
and went still further from the familiar
paths, so that finally he had to admit that he had
lost his way. Then he went farther and farther
into the woods until he saw far off a house....
</p>

<p>
The wanderer comes through the woods to the
Pratum felicitatis, the Meadow of Felicity, and
there his adventures begin. Here, too, our symbolism
is maintained; by sleeping or the transition
to revery we get into the dream and fairy tale realm,
a land to which the fulfillment of our keenest wishes
beckons us. The realm of fairy tales is indeed&mdash;and
the psychoanalyst can confirm this statement&mdash;a
Pratum felicitatis, in spite of all dangers and accidents
which we have there to undergo.
</p>

<p>
The dream play begins and the interpretation,
easy till now, becomes more difficult. We shall
hardly be able to proceed in strictly chronological
order. The understanding of the several phases of
the narrative does not follow the sequence of their
events. Let us take it as it comes.
</p>

<p>
The wanderer becomes acquainted with the inhabitants
of the Pratum felicitatis, who are discussing
learned topics, he becomes involved in the scientific
dispute, and is subjected to a severe test in
order to be admitted to the company. The admission
thus does not occur without trouble but rather
<pb n="048"/><anchor id="Pg048"/>
a great obstacle is placed in the way of it. The
wanderer tells us that his examiners hauled him
over the coals, an allegorical metaphor, taken possibly
from the ordeal by fire. In these difficulties the
attaining of the end meets us in the first instance in
a series of analogous events, where the wanderer
sees himself hindered in his activities in a more or
less painful, and often even a dangerous manner.
After a phase marked by anxiety the adventure turns
out uniformly well and some progress is made after
the obstruction at the beginning. As a first intimation
of the coming experiences we may take up
the obstacles in the path in the first section of the
parable, which are successfully removed, inasmuch
as the wanderer soon after reaches the lovely region
(Sec. 3).
</p>

<p>
The psychology of dreams has shown that obstacles
in the dream correspond to conflicts of will
on the part of the dreamer, which is exactly as in
the morbid restraint of neurotics. Anxiety develops
when a suppressed impulse wishes to gratify itself,
to which impulse another will, something determined
by our culture, is opposed prohibitively. Obstructed
satisfaction creates anxiety instead of pleasure.
Anxiety may then be called also a libido with a negative
sign. Only when the impulse in question knows
how to break through without the painful conflict,
can it attain pleasure&mdash;which is the psychic (not
indeed the biologic) tendency of every impulse
emanating from the depths of the soul. The degrees
of the pleasure that thus exists in the soul may
<pb n="049"/><anchor id="Pg049"/>
be very different, even vanishingly small, a state of
affairs occurring if the wish fulfilling experience has
through overgrowth of symbolism lost almost all of
its original form. If we follow the appearances of
the obstruction motive in the parable, and find the
regular happy ending already mentioned, then we
can maintain it as a characteristic of the phantasy
product in question, that not only in its parts but also
in the movement of the entire action, it shows a
tendency from anxiety towards untroubled fulfillment
of wishes.
</p>

<p>
As for the examination episode, to which we have
now advanced in our progressive study of the narrative,
we can now take up a frequently occurring
dream type; the Examination Dream. Almost
every one who has to pass severe examinations, experiences
even at subsequent times when the high
school or university examinations are far in the past,
distressing dreams filled with the anxiety that precedes
an examination. Freud (Trdtg., p. 196 ff.)
clearly says that this kind of dream is especially
the indelible memories of the punishments which we
have suffered in childhood for misdeeds and which
make themselves felt again in our innermost souls
at the critical periods of our studies, at the <hi rend='italic'>Dies
irae, dies ilia</hi> of the severe examinations. After
we have ceased to be pupils it is no longer as at
first the parents and governesses or later the teachers
that take care of our punishment. The inexorable
causal nexus of life has taken over our further
education, and now we dream of the preliminaries
<pb n="050"/><anchor id="Pg050"/>
or finals; whenever we expect that the result will
chastise us, because we have not done our duty, or
done something incorrectly, or whenever we feel
the pressure of responsibility. Stekel's experience
is also to be noticed, confirmed by the practice of
other psychoanalysts, that graduation dreams frequently
occur if a test of sexual power is at hand.
The double sense of the word <hi rend='italic'>matura</hi> (= ripe)
(that may also mean sexual maturity) may also
come to mind as the verbal connecting link for the
association. In general the examination dreams
may be the expression of an anxiety about not doing
well or not being able to do well; in particular they
are an expression of a fear of impotence. It should
be noted here that not only in the former but in the
latter case the fear has predominantly the force of
a psychic obstruction.
</p>

<p>
For the interpretation of the examination scene
also, we note the fairy tale motif so frequently appearing
of a hard-won prize, i.e., any story in which
a king or a potentate proposes a riddle or a task
for the hero. If the hero solves or accomplishes it,
he generally wins, besides other precious possessions,
a woman or a princess, whom he marries. In the
case of a heroine the prize is a beautiful prince.
The motif of the hard-won prize matches the later
appearance of obstacles in the Parable. The nature
of the prize is, for the present at any rate, a
matter of indifference.
</p>

<p>
A second edition of the examination scene meets
us in the 6th section as the battle with the lion.
<pb n="051"/><anchor id="Pg051"/>
The advance from the anxiety phase to the fulfillment
phase appears clearly and the emotions of the
wanderer are more strongly worked out. The difficulty
at the beginning is indicated in the preceding
conversation where no one will advise him how he
is to begin with the beast, but all hold out guidance
for a later time when he shall have once bound the
lion. The beginning of the fight causes the wanderer
much trouble. He <q>is amazed at his own
temerity,</q> would gladly turn back from his project,
and he can <q>hardly restrain his tears for fear.</q> He
fortifies himself, however, develops brilliant abilities
and comes off victor in the fray. A gratification
derived from his own ability is unmistakable.
The scene, as well as a variation of the preceding
examination, adds to it some essentially new details.
The displacement of the early opponents (i.e., the
examining elders) by another (the lion) is not really
new. It is a mere compensation, although, as we
shall see later, a very instructive one. Entirely new
is the result of the battle. After killing the lion the
victor brings to light white bones and red blood
from his body. Note the antithesis, white and red.
It will occur again. If we think of saga and fairy
lore parallels, the dragon fight naturally comes to
mind. The victorious hero has to free a maiden
who languishes in the possession of an ogre. The
anatomizing of the dead lion finds numerous analogies
in those myths and fairy tales in which dismemberment
of the body appears. It will be dealt with
fully later on.
</p>

<pb n="052"/><anchor id="Pg052"/>

<p>
As the next obstacle in the parable we meet the
difficult advance on the wall. (Para. 7 and 8.)
We have here again an obstruction to progress in
the narrower sense as in Sec. 1, but with several additions.
The wall, itself a type of embarrassment,
reaches up to the clouds. Whoever goes up so high
may fall far. The way on top is <q>Not a foot in
width</q> and an iron hand rail occupies some of that
space. The walking is therefore uncomfortable and
dangerous. The railing running in the middle of it
divides the path and so produces two paths, a right
and a left. The right path is the more difficult.
Who would not in this situation think of Hercules
at the cross roads? The conception of right and
left as right and wrong, good and bad, is familiar
in mythical and religious symbolism. That the
right path is the narrower [Matth. VII, 13, 14]
or more full of thorns is naturally comprehensible.
In dreams the right-left symbolism is typical. It
has here a meaning similar to its use in religion,
probably however, with the difference that it is
used principally with reference to sexual excitements
of such a character that the right signifies a permitted
(i.e., experienced by the dreamer as permissible),
the left, an illicit sexual pleasure. Accordingly it
is, e.g., characteristic in the dream about strawberry
picking in the preceding part of the book, that the
valley, sought by the dreamer and the boy, <q>in order
to pick strawberries there</q> turns off to the left from
the road, not to the right. The sexual act with a
boy appears even in dreams as something illicit, indecent,
<pb n="053"/><anchor id="Pg053"/>
forbidden. In the parable the wanderer
goes from right to left, gets into difficulties by doing
so, but knows, as always, how to withdraw successfully.
</p>

<p>
From the wall the wanderer comes to a rose tree,
from which he breaks off white and red roses. Notice
the white and red. The victory over the lion
has yielded him white bones and red blood, the passing
through the dangers on the wall now yields him
white and red roses. The similarity in the latter
case is particularly marked by his putting them in
his hat.
</p>

<p>
Again in the course of the next sections (9-11)
there are obstacles. There a wall is set up against
the wanderer. On account of that he has, in order
to gain entrance for the maidens into the company
in the garden, to go a long way round. Arriving
at the door, he finds it locked and is afraid that the
people standing about will prevent his entrance or
laugh at him. But the first difficulty is barely removed,
by the magic opening of the first gate, when
the now familiar change from the anxiety phase to
the fulfillment phase occurs. The wanderer traverses
the corridor without trouble but his eyes
glance ahead of him and he sees through the still
closed door, as if it were glass, into the garden.
What result has this success over the difficulties
yielded him? Where is the usual white and red reward?
We do not have to look long. In Sec. 11
it is recorded, <q>When I had passed beyond the little
garden [in the center of the larger garden] and was
<pb n="054"/><anchor id="Pg054"/>
going to the place where I was to help the maidens,
behold, I was aware that instead of the wall, a low
hurdle stood there, and there went by the rose garden,
the most beautiful maiden arrayed in white satin
with the most stately youth who was in scarlet, each
giving arm to the other, and carrying in their hands
many fragrant roses. <q>This, my dearest bridegroom,</q>
said she, <q>has helped me over and we are
now going out of this lovely garden into our chamber
to enjoy the pleasures of love.</q></q> Here the
parallel with the fairy tale is complete, and reveals
the characteristic of the prize that rewards him.
The red and the white reveal themselves as man and
woman, and the last aim is, as the just quoted passage
clearly shows, and the further course of the
narrative fully indicates, the sexual union of both.
Even the rest of the fairy tale prizes are not lacking&mdash;kingdoms,
riches, happiness. And if they are not
dead they are still living.... The narrative has
yielded a complete fulfillment of wishes; the longing
for love and power has attained its end. That the
wanderer does not experience the acquired happiness
immediately in his own person, but that the representation
of happy love is in the most illustrative
manner developed in the union of two other persons,
is naturally a peculiarity of the narration. It is
found often enough in dreams. The ego of the
dreamer is in such a case replaced by a <q>split-off</q>
person, through whom the dream evokes its dramatic
pageantry. It is as if the parable tried to
say the hero has won his happy love through struggle;
<pb n="055"/><anchor id="Pg055"/>
two are, however, needful for love, a man and
a woman, so let us quickly create a pair. Apart
from the fact that the reward must evidently fall to
the hero who has won it, the identity of the wanderer
with the king in the parable is abundantly
demonstrated, even if somewhat paraphrased. The
secret of the dramatizing craft of the narrative is
most clearly exposed in the conclusion of Sec. 11,
where the elders, with the letter of the faculty in
their hands, reveal to the wanderer that he must
marry the woman he has taken, which he furthermore
cheerfully promises them to do.
</p>

<p>
So far all would be regular and we might think,
on superficial examination, that the psychoanalytic
solution of the parable was ended. How far from
being the case! We have interpreted only the
upper stratum and will see a problem show itself
that invites us to press on into the deeper layers of
the phantasy fabric before us.
</p>

<p>
We have noticed that in the parable much, even
the most important, is communicated only by symbols
and by means of allusions. Its previously ascertained
latent content [corresponding to the latent
dream thoughts] will in the manifest form be transcribed
in different and gradually diminishing disguises.
Also a displacement (dream displacement)
has taken place. Now the dream or the imagination
working in dreams does nothing without purpose
and even though according to its nature (out
of <q>regard for presentability</q>) it has to favor the
visual in all cases, the tendency toward the pictorial
<pb n="056"/><anchor id="Pg056"/>
does not explain such a systematic series of disguises
and such a determinate tendency as that just observed
by us. The representation of the union of
man and woman is strikingly paraphrased. First
as blood and bones&mdash;a type of intimate vital connection;
they belong to <emph>one</emph> body, just as two lovers
are one and as later the bridal pair also melt into
one body. Then as two kinds of roses that bloom
on one bush. The wanderer breaks the rose as the
boy does the wild rose maiden. And hardly is the
veil of the previous disguise lifted, hardly have we
learned that the wanderer has taken a woman
(Sec. 11), when the affair is again hushed just as
it is about to be dramatized (cf. Sec. 12), so that
apparently another enjoys the pleasures of love.
This consequent concealment must have a reason.
Let us not forget the striking obstacles which the
wanderer experiences again and again and which
we have not yet thoroughly examined. The symbolism
of the dream tells us that such obstacles correspond
to conflicts of the will. What kind of inner
resistance may it be that checks the wanderer at
every step on his way to happy love? We suspect
that the examinations have an ethical flavor. This
appears to some extent in the right-left symbolism;
then in the experience at the mill, which we have not
yet studied, where the wanderer has to pass over a
very narrow plank, the ethical symbolism of which
will be discussed later; and in the striking feeling
of responsibility which the wanderer has for the
actions of the bridal pair in the crystal prison, which
<pb n="057"/><anchor id="Pg057"/>
gives us the impression that he had a bad conscience.
Altogether we cannot doubt that the dream&mdash;the
parable&mdash;has endeavored, because of the censor,
to disguise the sexual experiences of the wanderer.
We can be quite certain that it will be said that the
sexual as such will be forbidden by the censor. That
is, however, not the case. The account is outspoken
enough, and not the least prudish; the bridal pair
embrace each other naked, penetrate each other and
dissolve in love, melt in rapture and pain. Who
could ask more? Therefore the sexual act itself
could not have been offensive to the censor. The
whole machinery of scrupulousness, concealment
and deterrent objects, which stand like dreadful
watchmen before the doors of forbidden rooms, cannot
on the other hand be causeless. So the question
arises: What is it that the dream censor in the most
varied forms [lion, dangerous paths, etc.] has so
sternly vetoed?
</p>

<p>
In the strawberry dream related in the preceding
section, we have seen that a paraphrase of the latent
dream content appears at the moment when a form
of sexual intercourse, forbidden to the dreamer
by the dream censor, was to be consummated.
(Homosexual intercourse.) Most probably in the
parable also there is some form of sexuality rejected
by the censor. What may it be? Nothing indicates
a homosexual desire. We shall have to look
for another erotic tendency that departs from the
normal. From several indications we might settle
upon exhibitionism. This is, as are almost all abnormal
<pb n="058"/><anchor id="Pg058"/>
erotic tendencies, also an element of our normal
psychosexual constitution, but it is, if occurring too
prominently, a perversity against which the censor
directs his attacks. The incidents of the parable
that indicate exhibitionism are those where the wanderer
sees, through locked doors (Sec. 10) or walls
(Sec. 11), objects that can be interpreted as sexual
symbols. The miraculous sight corresponds to a
transferred wish fulfillment. The supposition that
exhibitionism is the forbidden erotic impulse element
that we were looking for is, however, groundless,
if we recollect that these very elements appear
most openly in the parable. In Sec. 14 the wanderer
has the freest opportunity to do as he likes.
Still the question arises, what is the prohibited tendency?
No very great constructive ability is required
to deduce the answer. The wording of the parable
itself furnishes the information. In Sec. 14 we
read, <q>Now I do not know what sin these two have
committed except that although they were brother
and sister they were so united in love that they could
not again be separated and so, as it were, required
to be punished for incest.</q> And in another passage
(Sec. 13), <q>After our bridegroom ... with his
dearest bride ... came to the age of marriage,
they both copulated at once and I wondered not a
little that this maiden, that yet was supposed to be
the bridegroom's mother, was still so young.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sexual propensity forbidden by the censor
is incest. That it can be mentioned in the parable
in spite of the censor is accounted for by the exceedingly
<pb n="059"/><anchor id="Pg059"/>
clever and unsuspected bringing about of the
suggestion. Dreams are very adroit in this respect,
and the same cleverness (apparently unconscious on
the part of the author) is found in the parable,
which is in every way analogous to the dream. Incest
can be explicitly mentioned, because it is attributed
to persons that have apparently nothing to do
with the wanderer. That the king in the crystal
prison is none other than the wanderer himself, we
indeed know, thanks to our critical analysis. The
dreamer of the dream does not know it. For him
the king is a different person, who is alone responsible
for his actions; although in spite of the clear disguise,
some feeling of responsibility still overshadows
the wanderer, a peculiar feeling that has struck
us before, and now is explained.
</p>

<p>
Later we shall see that from the beginning of the
parable, incest symbols are in evidence. Darkly
hinted at first they are later somewhat more transparent,
and in the very moment when they remove
the last veil and attain a significance intolerable for
the censor, exactly at that psychologic moment the
forbidden action is transferred to the other, apparently
strange, person.
</p>

<p>
A similar process, of course, is the change of situation
in the strawberry dream at the exact moment
when the affair begins to seem unpleasant to the
dreamer. This becoming unpleasant can be beautifully
followed out in the parable. The critical
transition is found exactly in one of those places
where the representation appears most confused.
<pb n="060"/><anchor id="Pg060"/>
It is in this way that the weakest points of the dream
surface are usually constituted. Those are the
places where the outer covering is threadbare and
exposes a nakedness to the view of the analyzer.
</p>

<p>
The critical phase of the parable begins in the
11th section. The elders consult over a letter from
the faculty. The wanderer notices that the contents
concern him and asks, <q>Gentlemen, does it have to
do with me?</q> They answer, <q>Yes, you must
marry your woman that you have recently taken.</q>
Wanderer: <q>That is no trouble; for I was, so to
speak, born [how subtle!] with her and brought up
from childhood with her.</q> Now the secret of the
incest is almost divulged. But it is at once effectually
retracted. In Sec. 12 we read, <q>So my
previous trouble and toil fell upon me and I bethought
myself that from strange causes [these
strange causes are the dream censor who, ruling in
the unconscious, effects the displacements that follow],
it cannot concern me but another that is well
known to me [in truth a well-known other]. Then
I see our bridegroom with his bride in the previous
attire going to that place ready and prepared for
copulation and I was highly delighted with it. For
I was in great anxiety lest the affair should concern
me.</q> The anxiety is quite comprehensible. It is
just on account of its appearance that the displacement
from the wanderer to the other person takes
place. Further in Sec. 13: <q>Now after ... our
bridegroom ... with his dearest bride ... came
to the age of marriage [The aim with which the
<pb n="061"/><anchor id="Pg061"/>
censor performs his duties and effects the dream
displacement is, says Freud (Trdtg., p. 193), <q>to
prevent the development of anxiety or other form of
painful affect</q>.] they both copulated ... and I wondered
not a little that this maiden, that was supposed
to be actually the <emph>mother</emph> of the bridegroom, was
still so young....</q> Now when the transfer has
taken place, the thought of its being the mother is
hazarded; whereas formerly a mere suggestion of
a sister had been offered. Section 14 explicitly mentions
incest and even arranges the punishment of the
guilt. In this form the matter can, of course, be
contemplated without troubling the conscience or
being further represented pictorially.
</p>

<p>
The sister, alternating in the narrative with the
mother, is only a preliminary to the latter. As we
find that the Œdipus complex [Rather an attenuation,
which occurs frequently, not merely in dream
psychology, but also in modern mythology.] is revived
in the parable, let us bring the latter into still
closer relation with the fairy tales and myths to
which we have compared it. The woman sought
and battled for by the hero appears, in its deeper
psychological meaning, always to be the mother.
The significance of the incest motive has been discovered
on the one hand by the psychoanalysts (in particular
Rank, who has worked over extensive material),
on the other by the investigators of myths.
That many modern mythologists lay most stress in
this discovery upon the astral or meteorological content
and do not draw the psychological conclusions
<pb n="062"/><anchor id="Pg062"/>
is another matter that will be discussed later. But
in passing it may be noted that the correspondence
in the discovered material (motives) is the more
remarkable as it resulted from working in the direction
of quite different purposes.
</p>

<p>
It is now time to examine the details of the parable
in conformity with the main theme just stated
and come to a definite interpretation. Henceforward
we may keep to a chronological order.
</p>

<p>
The threshold symbolism in the beginning of the
parable has already been given, also the obstacles
that are indicative of a psychic conflict. We might
rest satisfied with that, yet a more complete interpretation
is quite possible, in which particular
images are shown to be overdetermined. The way
is narrow, overgrown with bushes, and leads to the
Pratum felicitatis. That, according to a typical
dream symbolism, is also a part of the female body.
The obstacles in the way we recognize as a recoil
from or impediment to incest; so it is evident that
a definite female body, namely that of the mother,
is meant. The penetration leads to the Pratum
felicitatis, to blissful enjoyment. In fairy lore the
sojourn in the forest generally signifies death or the
life in the underworld. Wilhelm Muller, for example,
writes, <q>As symbols of similar significance
we have the transformation into swans or other
birds, into flowers, the exposure in the forest, the
life in the glass mountain, in a castle, in the woods....
All imply death and life in the underworld.</q>
The underworld is, when regarded mythologically,
<pb n="063"/><anchor id="Pg063"/>
not only the land where the dead go, but also whence
the living have come; thence for the individual, and
in particular for our wanderer, the uterus of the
mother. It is significant that the wanderer, as he
strolls along, ponders over the fall of our first parents
and laments it. The fall of the parents was a
sexual sin. That it was incest besides, will be considered
later. The son who sees in his father his
rival for his mother is sorry that the parents belong
to each other. A sexual offense (incest) caused the
loss of paradise. The wanderer enters the paradise,
the Pratum felicitatis. [Garden of Joy, Garden
of Peace, Mountain of Joy, etc., are names of
paradise. Now it is particularly noteworthy that
the same words can signify the beloved. (Grimm,
D. Mythol., II, pp. 684 ff., Chap. XXV, 781 f.)]
The path thither is not too rough for him (Sec. 2).
</p>

<p>
In Sec. 3 the wanderer enters his paradise (incest).
He finds in the father an obstacle to his
relation with the mother. The elders (splitting of
the person of the father) will not admit him, forbid
his entrance into the college. He himself, the youth
is already among them. The younger man, whose
name he knows without seeing his face, is himself.
He puts himself in the place of his father. (The
other young man with the black pointed beard may
be an allusion to a quite definite person, intended for
a small circle of readers of the parable, contemporaries
of the author. Either the devil or death
may be meant, yet I cannot substantiate this conjecture.)
</p>

<pb n="064"/><anchor id="Pg064"/>

<p>
In the fourth section the examinations begin.
First the examination in the narrower sense of the
word. The paternal atmosphere of every examination
has already been emphasized in the passage
from Freud quoted above. Every examination,
every exercise is associated with early impressions
of parental commands and punishments. Later
(in the treatment of the lion) the wanderer will
turn out to be the questioner, whereas now the
elders are the questioners. In the relation between
parent and child questions play a part that is important
from a psychological point of view. Amazingly
early the curiosity of the child turns toward
sexual matters. His desire to know things is centered
about the question as to where babies come
from. The uncommunicativeness of the parents
causes a temporary suppression of the great question,
which does not, however, cease to arouse his
intense desire for explanation. The dodging of the
issue produces further a characteristic loss of trust
on the part of the child, an ironic questioning, or a
feeling that he knows better. The knowing better
than the questioning father we see in the wanderer.
The tables are turned. Instead of the child desiring
(sexual) explanation from the parents, the father
must learn from the child (fulfillment of the
wish to be himself the father, as above). The
elders are acquainted only with figurative language
(<q>Similitudines,</q> <q>Figmenta,</q> etc.); but the wanderer
is well informed in practical life, in experience
<pb n="065"/><anchor id="Pg065"/>
he is an adept. As a fact, parents in their indefiniteness
about the question, Where do babies come
from? give a figurative answer (however appropriate
it may be as a figure of speech) in saying that
the stork brings them, while the child expects clear
information (from experience). On the propriety
of the picturesque information that the stork brings
the babies out of the water we may note incidentally
the following observations of Kleinpaul. The fountain
is the mother's womb, and the red-legged stork
that brings the babies is none other than a humorous
figure for the organ (phallus) with the long neck
like a goose or a stork, that actually gets the little
babies out of the mother's body. We understand
also that the stork has bitten Mamma in the <q>leg.</q>
</p>

<p>
We have become acquainted above with the fear
of impotence as one significance of the anxiety about
examinations. Psychosexual obstructions cause impotence.
The incest scruple is such an obstruction.
</p>

<p>
According to Laistner we can conceive the painful
examination as a question torture&mdash;a typical experience
of the hero in countless myths. Laistner,
starting from this central motive, traces the majority
of myths back to the incubus dream. The solution
of the tormenting riddle, the magic word that banishes
the ghost, is the cry of awakening, by which
the sleeper is freed from the oppressing dream, the
incubus. The prototype of the tormenting riddle
propounder is, according to Laistner, the Sphinx.
Sphinx, dragon, giants, man eaters, etc., are analogous
<pb n="066"/><anchor id="Pg066"/>
figures in myths. They are what afflict the
heroes, and what he has to battle with. The corresponding
figure in our parable is the lion.
</p>

<p>
Although the wanderer has brilliantly stood the
test, the elders (Sec. 5) do not admit him into their
college (the motive of denial recurs later); but
enter him for the battle with the lion. This is
surely a personification of the same obstructions as
the elders themselves. In them we have, so to
speak, before us the dragon (to be subdued) in a
plural form. Analogous multiplying of the dragon
is found, for example, in Stucken [in the astral
myth]. Typical dragon fighters are Jason, Joshua,
Samson, Indra; and their dragon enemies are multitudes
like the armed men from the sowing of the
dragon's teeth by Jason, the Amorites for Joshua,
the Philistines in the case of Samson, the Dasas in
that of Indra. We know that for the wanderer the
assemblage of elders is to be conceived chiefly as the
father, and the same is true now of the lion (king of
animals, royal beast, also in hermetic sense) who
has as lion been already appropriated to the father
symbol. Kaiser, king, giants, etc., are wont in
dreams to represent the father. Accordingly large
animals, especially wild beasts or beasts of prey, are
accustomed to appear in dreams with this significance.
</p>

<p>
Stekel [Spr. Tr.] contributes the following dream
of the patient Omicron: <q>I was at home. My
family had preserved a dead bear. His head was
of wood and out of his belly grew a mighty tree,
<pb n="067"/><anchor id="Pg067"/>
which looked very old. Around the animal's neck
was a chain. I pulled at it, and afterwards was
afraid that I had possibly choked him, in spite of
the fact that he was long dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
And the following interpretation of it derived
through analysis: <q>The bear is a growler, i.e., his
father, who has told him many a lie about the genesis
of babies. He reviles him for it. He was a
blockhead, he had a wooden head. The mighty tree
is the phallus. The chain is marriage. He was a
henpecked husband, a tamed bear. Mother held
him by the chain. This chain (the bond ? of
marriage) Omicron desired to sunder. (Incest
thoughts.) When the father died Omicron held
his hand over his father's mouth to find out whether
he was still breathing. Then he was pursued by
compulsive ideas, that he had killed his father. In
dreams the same reproaches appear. We realize
how powerful his murder impulses were. His reproaches
are justified. For he had countless death
wishes that were centered about that most precious
life.</q>
</p>

<p>
A girl not yet six years old told her mother the
following dream:
</p>

<p>
<q>We went together, there we saw a camel on a
rock, and you climbed up the cliff. The camel
wanted to keep slobbering you, but you wouldn't let
him, and said, <q>I'd like to do it, but if you are like
this, I won't do it.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
After the telling of the dream the mother asked
the girl if she could imagine what the camel signified
<pb n="068"/><anchor id="Pg068"/>
in the dream, and she immediately replied:
<q>Papa, because he has to drag along and worry himself
like a camel. You know, Mamma, when he
wants to slobber you it is as if he said to you in
camel talk, <q>Please play with me. I will marry
you; I won't let you go away.</q> The rocks on which
you are were steep, the path was quite clear, but the
railing was very dirty and there was a deep abyss,
and a man slipped over the railing into the abyss.
I don't know whether it was Uncle or Papa.</q>
</p>

<p>
Stekel remarks on this: <q>The neurotic child
understands the whole conflict of the parents. The
mother refused the father coitus. In this she will
not <q>play</q> with the camel. The camel wants to
<q>marry</q> her. It is quite puzzling how the child
knows that Mamma has long entertained thoughts
of separation.... Children evidently observe
much more sharply and exactly than we have yet suspected.
The conclusion of the dream is a quite
transparent symbolism of coitus. But the dream
thoughts go deeper yet. A man falls into an abyss.
The father goes on little mountain expeditions.
Does the child wish that the father may fall? The
father treats the child badly and occasionally strikes
her unjustly. At all events it is to be noted that
the little puss says to her mother, <q>Mamma, isn't
it true that when Papa dies you will marry Dr.
Stekel?</q> Another time she chattered, <q>You know,
Mamma, Dr. N. is nicer than Papa; he would suit
you much better.</q> Also the antithesis of clean and
<pb n="069"/><anchor id="Pg069"/>
dirty, that later plays such an important part in the
psychic life of neurotics, is here indicated.</q>
</p>

<p>
Not only the camel but also the railing and the
abyss are interesting in relation to Sec. 7 and 8 of
the parable, where occurs the perilous wall with the
railing. People fall down there. There is evidently
here an intimate primitive symbolism (for
the child also). But I will not anticipate.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to add anything to the bear
dream. It is quite clear. Only one point must be
noticed, that the subsequent concern about the dead
is to be met in the parable, though not on the wanderer's
part but on that of the elders who desire the
reviving of the lion.
</p>

<p>
The wanderer describes the lion (Sec. 6) as <q>old,
fierce and large.</q> (The growling bear of the
dream.) The glance of his eye is the impressively
reproachful look of the father.
</p>

<p>
The wanderer conquers the lion and <q>dissects</q>
him. Red blood, white bones, come to view, male
and female; the appearance of the two elements is,
at any rate overdetermined in meaning as it signifies
on the one hand the separation of a pair, father
and mother, originally united as one body; and on
the other hand the liberation of sexuality in the mind
of the wanderer (winning of the mother or of the
dragon-guarded maiden).
</p>

<p>
We ought not to explain the figures of the lion
and the elders as <q>the father.</q> Such exalted figures
are usually condensations or composite persons.
<pb n="070"/><anchor id="Pg070"/>
The elders are not merely the father, but also the
old, or the older ones = parents in general, in so far
as they are severe and unapproachable. Apparently
the mother also will prove unapproachable if
the adult son desires her as a wife. [The male
child, on the other hand, frequently has erotic experiences
with the mother. The parents connive at
these, because they do not understand the significance
even of their own caresses. They generally
do not know how to fix the limits between moderation
and excess.] The wanderer has no luck with
blandishments in the case of the lion. He begins
indeed to fondle him (cf. Sec. 6), but the lion looks
at him formidably with his bright, shining eyes. He
is not obliging; the wanderer has to struggle with
him. Offering violence to the mother often appears
in myths. We shall have an example of this later.
It is characteristic that the wanderer is amazed at
his own audacity.
</p>

<p>
Dragon fighting, dismembering, incest, separation
of parents, and still other motives have an intimate
connection in mythology. I refer to the comparison
of motives collected by Stucken from an imposing
array of material. [I quote an excerpt from it at
the end of this volume, <ref target="Note_A">Note A</ref>.] The motive of
dismemberment has great significance for the subsequent
working out of my theme, so I must for that
reason delay a little longer at this point.
</p>

<p>
The parts resulting from the dismemberment have
a sexual or procreative value. That is evident from
the analysis of the parable, even without the support
<pb n="071"/><anchor id="Pg071"/>
of mythological parallels. None the less let it be
noticed that many cosmogonies assign the origin of
the universe or at least the world or its life to the
disintegrated parts of the body of a great animal
or giant. In the younger Edda the dismemberment
of the giant Ymir is recounted.

The Iranian myth has an ancestor bull, Abudad.
<q>From his left side goes Goschorum, his soul, and
rises to the starry heavens; from his right side came
forth Kajomorts (Gâyômard), the first man. Of
his seed the earth took a third, but the moon two
thirds. From his horns grew the fruits, from his
nose, leeks, from his blood, grapes, from his tail, five
and twenty kinds of grain. From his purified seed
two new bulls were formed, from which all animals
are descended.</q> Just as in the Iranian myth the
original being, Gâyômard, considered as human, and
the ancestor bull belong together, so we find in the
northern myth a cow Audhumla associated with
Ymir. Ymir is to be regarded as androgynous
(man and woman), the primitive cow as only a
doubling of his being. The Iranian primitive bull
ancestor also occurs as cow. Compare white and
red, male and female, in the body of the lion.

<p>
In the Indian Asvamedha the parts of the sacrificed
steed correspond to the elements of the visible
creation. (Cf. Brhadaranyaka&mdash;Upanisad I, i.)
A primitive vedic cosmogony makes the world arise
from the parts of the body of a giant. (Rig-veda
purusa-sukta.)
</p>

<p>
Just as from the dead primordial being the sacrificed
bull, Mithra, sprouts life and vegetation, so in
the dream of Omicron, a tree grows out of the belly
of the dead bear. In mythology many trees grow
out of graves, that in some way reincarnate the
creative or life principle of the dead. It is an interesting
fact that the world, or especially an improved
new edition of the world, comes from the body of
a dying being. Some one kills this being and so
causes an improved creation. (According to
Stucken, incidentally, all myths are creation myths.)
This improvement is now identical, psychologically,
with the above mentioned superior knowledge of the
son (expressed in general terms, the present new
generation as opposed to the ancestors). The son
does away with the father (the children overpower
the ancestors), and creates, as it were out of the
wreckage, an improved world. So, beside the superior
knowledge, a superior efficiency. The primordial
beings are destroyed but not so the creative
power (phallus, tree, the red and the white). It
passes on to posterity (son) which uses it in turn.
</p>

<p>
Dismemberments in creation myths are not always
multiple but sometimes dichotomous. Thus in the
Babylonian cosmogony Marduk splits the monster
<pb n="073"/><anchor id="Pg073"/>
Tiamat into two pieces, which henceforth become
the upper and lower half of heaven. Winckler
concludes that Tiamat is man-woman (primal pair).
This brings us to the type of creation saga where
the producer of the (improved) world separates the
primal pair, his parents. The Chinese creation
myth speaks of the archaic Chaos as an effervescing
water, in which the two powers, Yang (heaven) and
Yin (earth), the two primal ancestors, are mingled
and united. Pwanku, an offshoot of these primal
powers (son of the parents), separates them and
thus they become manifest. In the Egyptian myth
we read (in Maspero, Histoire des Peuples de
l'Orient, Stucken, Astral Myth, p. 203): <q>The
earth and the heaven were in the beginning a pair
of lovers lost in the Now who held each other in
close embrace, the god below the goddess. Now on
the day of creation a new god [son type], Shou, came
out of the eternal waters, glided between them and
seizing Nouit [the goddess] with his hands, lifted
her at arms' length above his head. While the
starry bust of the goddess was lengthened out in
space, the head to the west, the loins to the east, and
became the sky, her feet and her hands [as the four
pillars of heaven] fell here and there on our earth.</q>
The young god or the son pushes his way between
the parents, sunders their union, just as the dreamer
Omicron would have liked to sunder the chain of
the bear (the marriage bond of the parents). This
case is quite as frequent a type in analytic psychology
as in mythical cosmology. The child is actually
<pb n="074"/><anchor id="Pg074"/>
an intruder, even if it does indirectly draw the bonds
of marriage tighter. Fundamentally regarded, the
child appears as the rival of the father, who is no
longer the only beloved one of his wife. He must
share the love with the new comer, to whom an even
greater tenderness is shown. Regarded from the
standpoint of the growing son, the intrusion represents
the Œdipus motive (with the incest wish).
</p>

<p>
The most outspoken and also a commonly occurring
form of the mythological separation of the
primal pair is the castration of the father by the
son. The motive is, according to all accounts, psychologically
quite as comprehensible as the frequently
substituted castration of the son by the father.
The latter is psychologically the necessary
correlate of the first form. The rivals, father and
son, menace each other's sexual life. That the castration
motive works out that way with father and
son (son-in-law if the daughter takes the place of
the mother) is expressed either in so many words
in the myth or through corresponding displacement
types.
</p>

<p>
A clear case is the emasculation of Uranus by
his son Kronos, who thereby prevents the further
cohabitation of the primal parents. [Archetype of
the Titan motive in a narrow sense.] Important
for us is the fact that castration in myths is represented
sometimes as the tearing out of a limb or by
complete dismemberment. (Stucken, Astral Myth,
pp. 436, 443, 479, 638 ff.; Rank, Incest Motive,
p. 311 ff.)
</p>

<pb n="075"/><anchor id="Pg075"/>

<p>
The Adam myth also contains the motive of the
separated primal parents. In Genesis we do not, of
course, see the myth in its pure form. It must first
be rehabilitated. Stucken accomplishes this in regarding
Adam and Eve (Hawwa) as the original
world-parent pair, and Jahwe Elohim as the separating
son god. By a comparison of Adam and
Noah he incidentally arrives by analogical reasoning
at an emasculation of Adam. In connection
with the <q>motive of the sleeping primal father,</q> he
observes later (Astral Myth, p. 224) that the emasculation
(or the shameless deed, Ham with Noah)
is executed while the primal father lies asleep.
Thus, Kronos emasculates Uranus by night while
he is sleeping with Gaia. Stucken now shows that
the sleep motive is contained in the 2d chapter of
Genesis. <q>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep
to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of
his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.</q>
(II, 21.) According to Stucken the rib stands
euphemistically for the organ of generation, which
is cut off from Adam while he sleeps.
</p>

<p>
Rank works out another kind of rearrangement.
He takes the creation of Eve from Adam as an inversion.
He refers to the ever recurring world-parent
myths of savage peoples, in which the son
begets upon the mother a new generation. He cites
after Frobenius a story from Joruba, Africa, where
the son and daughter of the world parents marry
and have a son, who falls in love with his mother.
As she refuses to yield to his passion he follows and
<pb n="076"/><anchor id="Pg076"/>
overpowers her. She immediately jumps up and
runs away crying. The son follows her to soothe
her, and when he catches her she falls sprawling on
the earth, her body begins to swell, two streams of
water spring from her breasts and her body falls
in pieces. Fifteen gods spring from her disrupted
body. [Motive of the mutilation of the maternal
body. The dismembered lion also naturally contains
this motive. From the mutilated body come
male and female (red and white) children.] Rank
supposes that the biblical account of the world parents
serves as a mask for incest (and naturally at
the same time the symbolic accomplishment of the
incest). He continues, <q>It is needed only that the
infantile birth theory [Birth from anus, navel, etc.
The taking of the rib = birth process.] which ignores
the sexual organs in woman and applies to
both sexes, be raised in the child's thought to the
next higher grade of knowledge, which ascribes to
the woman alone the ability to bring children into
the world by the opening of her body. In opposition
to the biblical account we have the truly natural
process, according to which Adam came out of the
opened body of Eve. If by analogy with other traditions,
we may take this as the original one, it is
clear that Adam has sexual intercourse with his
mother, and that the disguising of this shocking incest
furnished the motive for the displacement of the
saga and for the symbolic representation of its contents.</q>
The birth from the side of the body, from
the navel, from the anus, etc., are among children
<pb n="077"/><anchor id="Pg077"/>
common theories of birth. In myths analogous to
the biblical apple episode the man almost always
offers the apple to the woman. The biblical account
is probably an inversion. The apple is an apple of
love and an impregnation symbol. Impregnation by
food is also an infantile procreation theory. For
Rank, therefore, it is Adam who is guilty of separating
the primal parents [Jahwe and Hawwa] and of
incest with the mother. The contrast between the
two preceding conceptions of the Adam myth should
not be carried beyond limits. That they can stand
side by side is the more conceivable because Genesis
itself is welded together from heterogeneous parts
and different elaborations of the primal pair motive.
Displacements, inversions, and therefore apparent
contradictions must naturally lie in such a material.
Moreover, the interpretation depends not so much
on the narrative of the discovered motives as on the
motives themselves. [On the interpretation of the
mythological motives cf. Lessmann, Aufg. u. Ziele,
p. 12.]
</p>

<p>
Let us return now to the motive of dismemberment.
One of the best known examples of dismemberment
in mythology is that of Osiris. Osiris and
Isis, the brother and sister, already violently in love
with each other in their mother's womb, as the myth
recounts, copulated with the result that Arueris was
born of the unborn. So the two gods came into the
world as already married brother and sister. Osiris
traversed the earth, bestowing benefits on mankind.
But he had a bad brother, full of jealousy and envy,
<pb n="078"/><anchor id="Pg078"/>
Typhon (Set), who would gladly have taken advantage
of the absence of his brother to place himself
on his throne. Isis, who ruled during the absence
of Osiris, acted so vigorously and resolutely
that all his evil designs were frustrated. Finally
Osiris returned and Typhon, with a number of confederates
(the number varies) and with the Ethiopian
queen Aso, formed a conspiracy against the
life of Osiris, and in feigned friendship arranged a
banquet. He had, however, caused a splendid coffin
to be made, and as they sat gayly at the feast, Typhon
had it brought in, and offered to give it to the
person whose body would fit it. He had secretly
taken the measure of Osiris and had prepared the
coffin accordingly. All tried it in turn. None
fitted. Finally Osiris lay in it. Then Typhon and
his confederates rushed up, closed it and threw it into
the river, which carried it to the sea. (Creuzer, L.,
p. 259 ff.) For the killing of his brother Set, which
happened according to the original version on account
of desire for power, later tradition substitutes
an unconscious incest which Osiris committed with
his second sister, Nephthys, the wife of Set, a union
from which sprang Anubis (the dog-headed god).
Set and Nephthys are, according to H. Schneider,
apparently no originally married brother and sister
like Osiris and Isis, but may have been introduced
by way of duplication, in order to account for the
war between Osiris and his brother. With the help
of Anubis, Isis finds the coffin, brings it back to
Egypt, opens it in seclusion and gives way to her
<pb n="079"/><anchor id="Pg079"/>
tender feelings and sorrow for him. Thereupon
she hides the coffin with the body in a thicket in the
forest in a lonely place. A hunt which the wild
hunter Typhon arranges, discovers the coffin. Typhon
cuts the body into fourteen pieces. Isis soon
discovers the loss and searches in a papyrus canoe
for the dismembered body of Osiris, traveling
through all the seven mouths of the Nile, till she
finally has found thirteen pieces. Only one is lacking,
the phallus, which had been carried out to sea
and swallowed by a fish. She put the pieces together
and replaced the missing male member by
another made of sycamore wood and set up the
phallus for a memento (as a sanctuary). With the
help of her son Horus, who, according to later traditions,
was begotten by Osiris after his death, Isis
avenged the murder of her spouse and brother.
Between Horus and Set, who originally were brothers
themselves, there arises a bitter war, in which
each tore from the other certain parts of the body
as strength-giving amulets. Set knocked an eye out
of his opponent and swallowed it, but lost at the
same time his own genitals (testicles), which in the
original version were probably swallowed by Horus.
Finally Set was overcome and compelled to give up
Horus' eye, with the help of which Horus again
revivified Osiris so that he could enter the kingdom
of the dead as a ruler.
</p>

<p>
The dismemberment, with final loss of the phallus,
will be clearly recognized as a castration. The tearing
out of the eye is similarly to be regarded as emasculation.
<pb n="080"/><anchor id="Pg080"/>
This motive is found as self-punishment
for incest, at the close of the Œdipus drama. On
the dismemberment of Osiris as a castration, Rank
writes (Inz. Mot., p. 311): <q>The characteristic
phallus consecration of Isis shows us that her sorrow
predominantly concerns the loss of the phallus,
(and it also is expressed in the fact that according
to a later version, she is none the less in a
mysterious manner impregnated by her emasculated
spouse), so on the other hand the conduct of the
cruel brother shows us that in the dismemberment he
was particularly interested in the phallus, since that
indeed was the only thing not to be found, and had
evidently been hidden with special precautionary
measures. Indeed both motivations appear closely
united in a version cited by Jeremias (Babylonisches
in N. T., p. 721), according to which Anubis, the son
of the adulterous union of Osiris with his sister
Nephthys, found the phallus of Osiris, dismembered
by Typhon with 27 assistants, which Isis had hidden
in the coffin. Only in this manner could the phallus
from which the new age originated, escape from
Typhon. If this version clearly shows that Isis
originally had preserved in the casket the actual phallus
of her husband and brother which had been made
incorruptible and not merely a wooden one, then on
the other hand the probability increases that the
story originally concerns emasculation alone because
of the various weakening and motivating attempts
that meet us in the motive of the dismemberment.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the form of the Osiris saga the dismemberment
<pb n="081"/><anchor id="Pg081"/>
appears, however, not merely as emasculation.
More clearly recognizable is also the separation of
the primal parents, the dying out of the primal being
resulting in a release of the primal procreative power
for a fresh world creation. It is a very interesting
point that in one of the versions a mighty tree grows
out of the corpse of Osiris. Later on we become
acquainted for the first time with the potent motive
of the restoration of the dismembered one, the revivification
of the dead.
</p>

<p>
For example, in the Finnish epic, Kalevala,
Nasshut throws the Lemminkainen into the waters
of the river of the dead. Lemminkainen was dismembered,
but his mother fished out the pieces, one
of which was missing, put them together and brought
them to life in her womb. According to Stucken's
explanation we recognize in Nasshut a father image,
in Lemminkainen a son image. In the tradition no
relationship between them is mentioned. That is,
however, a <q>Differentiation and attenuation of
traits, which is common in every myth-maker.</q> (S.
A. M., p. 107.)
</p>

<p>
In the Edda it is recounted <q>that Thor fared
forth with his chariot and his goats and with him
the Ase, called Loki. They came at evening to a
peasant and found shelter with him. At night Thor
took his goats and slew them; thereupon they were
skinned and put into a kettle. And when they were
boiled Thor sat down with his fellow travelers to
supper. Thor invited the peasant and his wife and
two children to eat with him. The peasant's son
<pb n="082"/><anchor id="Pg082"/>
was called Thialfi and the daughter Roskwa. Then
Thor laid the goats' skins near the hearth and said
that the peasant and his family should throw the
bones onto the skins. Thialfi, the peasant's son,
had the thigh bone of one goat and cut it in two
with his knife to get the marrow. Thor stayed
there that night, and in the morning he got up before
dawn, dressed, took the hammer, Miolner, and lifted
it to consecrate the goats' skins. Thereupon the
goats stood up; but one of them was lame in the
hind leg. He noticed it and said that the peasant
or some of his household must have been careless
with the goats' bones, for he saw that a thigh bone
was broken.</q> We are especially to note here that
the hammer is a phallic symbol.
</p>

<p>
In fairy tales the dismemberments and revivifications
occur frequently. For example, in the tale of
the Juniper Tree [Machandelboom] (Grimm, K. H.
M., No. 47), a young man is beheaded, dismembered,
cooked and served up to his father to be
eaten. The father finds the dish exceptionally good.
On asking for his son he is answered that the youth
has gone to visit relatives. The father throws all
the bones under the table. They are collected by
the sister, wrapped in a bit of cloth and laid under
the juniper tree. The soul of the boy soared in
the air as a bird and was afterward translated into
a living youth. The Grimm brothers introduce as
a parallel: <q>The collection of the bones occurs in
the myths of Osiris and Orpheus, and in the legend
of Adelbert; the revivification in many others, e.g.,
<pb n="083"/><anchor id="Pg083"/>
in the tale of Brother Lustig (K. H. M., No. 81),
of Fichter's Vogel (No. 46), in the old Danish song
of the Maribo-Spring, in the German saga of the
drowned child, etc.</q> Moreover, W. Mannhardt
(Germ. Mythen., pp. 57-75) has collected numerous
sagas and fairy tales of this kind, in which
occur the revivifications of dismembered cattle, fish,
goats, rams, birds, and men.
</p>

<p>
The gruesome meal in the story of the juniper tree
reminds us of the Tantalus story and the meal of
Thyestes. Demeter (or Thetes) ate a shoulder of
the dismembered Pelops, who was set before the
gods by his father Tantalus, and the shoulder, after
he was brought to life again, was replaced by an
ivory one. In a story from the northeastern Caucasus,
a chamois similarly dismembered and brought
to life, like Thor's goats, gets an artificial shoulder
(of wood).
</p>

<p>
For the purpose of being brought to life again
the parts of the dismembered animal are regularly
put in a vessel or some container (kettle, box, cloth,
skin). In the case of the kettle, which corresponds
to the belly or uterus, they are generally cooked.
Thus in the tale of the juniper tree, the magic rejuvenations
of Medea, which&mdash;except in the version
mentioning the magic potion&mdash;she practices
on Jason and Æson, and also on goats (cf. Thor
and his goats). I must quote still other pertinent
observations of Rank (p. 313 ff). The motive of
revivification, most intimately connected with dismemberment,
appears not only in a secondary rôle
<pb n="084"/><anchor id="Pg084"/>
to compensate for the killing, but represents as well
simple coming to life, i.e., birth. Rank believes
that coming to life again applies originally to a dissected
snake (later other animals, chiefly birds), in
which we easily recognize the symbolical compensation
for the phallus of the Osiris story, excised and
unfit for procreation, which can be brought to life
again by means of the water of life. <q>The idea
that man himself at procreation or at birth is assembled
from separate parts, has found expression not
only in the typical widespread sexual theories of children,
but in countless stories (e.g., Balzac's Contes
drolatiques) and mythical traditions. Of special
interest to us is the antique expression communicated
by Mannhardt (Germ. Myth., p. 305), which says
of a pregnant woman that she has a belly full of
bones,</q> which strikingly suggests the feature emphasized
in all traditions that the bones of the dismembered
person are thrown on a heap, or into a
kettle (belly) or wrapped in a cloth. [Even the
dead Jesus, who is to live again, is enveloped in a
cloth. In several points he answers the requirements
of the true rejuvenation myth. The point is
also made that the limbs that are being put in the
cloth must be intact, so that the resurrection may
be properly attained (as in a bird story where the
dead bird's bones must be carefully preserved).
The incompleteness (stigmata) also appears after
the resurrection.

John <hi rend='smallcaps'>XIX</hi>, 33. <q>But when they came to Jesus,
and saw that he was dead already, they brake not
<pb n="085"/><anchor id="Pg085"/>
his legs.</q>&mdash;40 f. <q>Then took they the body of
Jesus and wound it in linen cloths with the spices....
Now in the place where he was crucified there
was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulcher,
wherein was never man yet laid.</q>
</p>

<p>
We shall mention later the significance of garden
and grave. It supports that of the cloths.]
</p>

<p>
Rank considers that the circumstance that the dismembered
person or animal resurrected generally
lacks a member, points without exception to castration.
</p>

<p>
What he has said about dismemberment we can
now sum up with reference to the lion in the parable
in the formulae: Separation of parents; the pushing
aside of the father; castration of father; taking his
place; liberation of the power of procreation; improvement.
In its bearing on the incest wish, castration
is indeed the best translation of the <q>anatomizing</q>
of the lion. The dragon fighter has to
release a woman. The idea that the mother is in
need of being released, and that it is a good deed
to free her from her oppressor, father, is according
to the insight of psychoanalysis a typical element
of those unconscious phantasies of mankind, which
are stamped deeply with the greatest significance in
the imaginative <q>family romance</q> of neurotics.
To the typical dragon fight belongs, however (according
to Stucken's correct formulation), the motive
of denial. As a matter of fact the hero of our
parable is denied the prize set before him&mdash;the
admission into the college&mdash;for several of the
<pb n="086"/><anchor id="Pg086"/>
elders insist on the condition that the wanderer must
resuscitate the lion (Sec. 7). In myths where the
dragon has to fight with a number of persons this
difference generally occurs: that he produces dissension
among his opponents. (Jason throws a stone
among the men of the dragon's teeth, they fight
about the stone and lay each other low.) Dissension
occurs also among the old men. They turned
(Sec. 7) <q>fiercely on each other</q> if only with
words.
</p>

<p>
The wanderer removes, as it were, an obstacle by
the fight, tears down a wall or a restraint. This
symbol occurs frequently in dreams; flying or
jumping over walls has a similar meaning. The
wanderer was carried as if in flight to the top of
the wall. Then first returns the hesitation. The
symbolism of the two paths, right and left, has already
been mentioned. The man that precedes the
wanderer (Sec. 7 and 8) may be quite properly
taken as the father image; once, at any rate, because
the wanderer finds himself on the journey to the
mother (that is indeed the trend of the dream) and
on this path the father is naturally the predecessor.
The father is, however, the instructor, too, held up
as an example and as a model for choosing the right
path. The father follows the right path to the
mother also; he is the lawful husband. The son
can reach her only on the left path. This he takes,
still for the purpose of making things better. Some
one follows the wanderer on the other side (Sec. 8),
whether man or woman is not known. The father
<pb n="087"/><anchor id="Pg087"/>
image in front of the wanderer is his future for he
will occupy his father's place. The Being behind
him is surely the past, the careless childhood, that
has not yet learned the difference between man and
woman. It does not take the difficult right way,
but quite intelligibly, the left. The wanderer himself
turns back to his childish irresponsibility; he
takes the left path. The many people that fall
down may be a foil to illustrate the dangers of the
path, for the purpose of deepening the impression
of improvement. Phantasies of extraordinary abilities,
special powers; contrasts to the anxiety of examinations;
all these in the case of the wanderer
mark the change from apprehension to fulfillment.
We must not fail to recognize the element of desire
for honor; it will be yet described. In view of myth
motives reported by Stucken, the entire wall episode
is to be conceived as a magic flight; the people that
fall off are the pursuers.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the ninth section of the parabola,
the wanderer breaks red and white roses from
the rosebush and sticks them in his hat. Red-white
we already know as sexuality. The breaking off of
flowers, etc., in dreams generally signifies masturbation;
common speech also knows this as <q>pulling
off</q> or <q>jerking off.</q> In the symbolism of dreams
and of myths the hat is usually the phallus. This
fact alone would be hardly worth mentioning, but
there are also other features that have a similar significance.
The fear of impotence points to autoerotic
components in the psychosexual constitution of
<pb n="088"/><anchor id="Pg088"/>
the wanderer (of course not clearly recognized as
such), which is shown as well in the anxiety about
ridicule and disgrace that awaken ambition. This
is clearest in the paragraphs 6, 10, 14, of the parable.
That the masturbatory symbol precedes the
subsequent garden episode, can be understood if we
realize that the masturbation phantasy (which has
an enormous psychic importance) animates or predetermines
the immediately following incest.
</p>

<p>
The wall about the garden that makes the long
detour necessary (Sec. 9) is as we know the resistance.
Overcoming the resistance = going round
the wall, removal of the wall. Of course, after
the completion of the detour there is no wall. The
wall, however, signifies also the inaccessibility or
virginity of the woman. The wall surrounds a
garden. The garden is, however (apart from the
paradise symbolism derived from it), one of the
oldest and most indubitable symbols for the female
body.

</p>

<p>
The wanderer wishes to possess his mother as an
unravished bride. Also a feature familiar to psychoanalysis.
The generally accompanying antithesis
is the phantasy that the mother is a loose woman
= attainable, sexually alluring woman. Perhaps
this idea will also be found in the parable.
</p>

<p>
The young people of both sexes, separated by a
wall, do not come together because they are afraid
of the distant detour to the door. This can, with
a little courage, be translated: The auto-erotic satisfaction
is easier.
</p>

<p>
[C G. Jung writes (Jb. ps. F., IV, p. 213 ff):
<q>Masturbation is of inestimable importance psychologically.
One is guarded from fate, since there is
no sexual need of submitting to any one, life and its
difficulties. With masturbation one has in his hands
the great magic. He needs only to imagine and in
addition to masturbate and he possesses all the pleasures
of the world and is under no compulsion to
conquer the world of his desire through hard work
and struggle with reality. Aladdin rubs his lamp
and the slaves come at his bidding; this story expresses
the great psychologic gain in local sexual satisfaction
<pb n="090"/><anchor id="Pg090"/>
through facile regression.</q> Jung applies
to masturbation the motive of the dearly won prize
and that of the stealing of fire. He even appears to
derive in some way the use of fire from masturbation.
In this at any rate I cannot follow him.]
</p>

<p>
On his detour the wanderer (who desires to reach
the portal of woman) meets people who are alone in
the rooms and carry on dirty work. Dirt and masturbation
are wont to be closely associated psychically.
The dirty work is <q>only appearance and individual
fantasy,</q> and <q>has no foundation in Nature.</q>
The wanderer knows that <q>such practices
vanish like smoke.</q> He has done it himself before
and now he will have nothing more to do with it.
He aspires to a woman, that the work done alone
leads to nothing is connected with the fact that the
work of two is useful. But <q>dirty work</q> is also to
be understood as sensual enjoyment without love.
</p>

<p>
In paragraph 10 we again meet the already mentioned
symbolism of the walled garden. The wanderer
is the only one that can secure admission to
the maiden. After a fear of impotence (anxiety
about disgrace) he goes resolutely to the door and
opens it with his Diederich, which sticks into a narrow,
hardly visible opening (deflowering). He
<q>knows the situation of the place,</q> although he has
never been there before. I mean that once, before
he was himself, he was there in the body of his
mother. What follows suggests a birth fantasy as
these occur in dreams of being born. The wanderer
now actually takes part in being born in reverse direction.
<pb n="091"/><anchor id="Pg091"/>
I append several dreams about being born.
</p>

<p>
<q>I find myself on a very narrow stairway, leading
down in turns; a winding stairway. I turn and
push through laboriously. Finally I find a little
door that leads me into the open, on a green meadow,
where I rest in soft luxuriant bushes. The warm
sunshine was very pleasant.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. S. dreams: <q>In the morning I went to work
with my brother (as we went the same road) in the
Customs House Street. Before the customs house
I saw the head postillion standing. From it the
way led to a street between two wooden walls; the
way appeared very long and seemed to get narrower
toward the end and indeed so close that I was afraid
that we would not get through. I went out first, my
brother behind me; I was glad when I got out of the
passage and woke with a beating heart.</q> Addenda.
<q>The way was very dark, more like a mine. We
couldn't see, except in the distance the end, like a
light in a mine shaft. I closed my eyes.</q> Stekel
notes on the dreams of F. S.: <q>The dream is a
typical birth dream. The head postillion is the father.
The dreamer wants to reverse the birth relations
of his brother who is ten years older than he.
<q>I went out first, my brother after me.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
Another beautiful example in Stekel: <q>Inter
faeces et urinas nascimur.</q> [We are born between
faeces and urine] says St. Augustine. Mr. F. Z. S.
contributes an account of his birth which strongly
reminds us of the sewer-theory.
</p>

<p>
<q>I went into the office and had to pass a long,
<pb n="092"/><anchor id="Pg092"/>
narrow, uneven alley. The alley was like a long
court between two houses and I had the indefinite
feeling that there was no thoroughfare. Yet I hurried
through. Suddenly a window over me opened
and some one, I believe a female, spilled the wet
contents of a vessel on me. My hat was quite wet
and afterwards I looked at it closer and still noticed
the traces of a dirty gray liquid. Nevertheless,
I went on without stopping, and quickened my
steps. At the end of the alley I had to go through
the house that was connected by the alley with the
other. Here I found an establishment (inn?) that
I passed. In this establishment were people (porters,
servants, etc.) engaged in moving heavy pieces
of furniture, etc., as if these were being moved out
or rearranged. I had to be careful and force my
way through. Finally I came to the open on a
street and looked for an electric. Then I saw on a
path that went off at an angle, a man whom I took
for an innkeeper who was occupied in measuring or
fastening a hedge or a trellis. I did not know exactly
what he was doing. He was counting or muttering
and was so drunk that he staggered.</q>
</p>

<p>
Stekel: <q>In this dream are united birth and
effects of the forbidden or unpermissible. The
dreamer goes back over the path&mdash;evidently as an
adult. The experiences represent an accusation
against the mother. This accusation was not without
reason. Mr. F. Z. S. had a joyless childhood.
His mother was a heavy drinker. He witnessed her
<pb n="093"/><anchor id="Pg093"/>
coitus with strangers. (Packing up = coitus.)
The packers and porters are the strange men who
visited his inn (his mother was also his nurse) in
order to store heavy objects, etc. Finally he was
obstructed in his birth, for a man is occupied in
measuring. The father was a surveyor (the innkeeper).
In the dream, furthermore, he was measuring
a trellis-fence. Both trellis and hedge are
typical dream symbols of obstacles to copulation.</q>
</p>

<p>
Comparing Sections 10 and 11 of the parable
carefully with the contents of this dream, we find
astonishing correspondences. Notice the details,
e.g., the rosebushes, the sun, the rain, the hedge.
On the <q>well builded house</q> of Section 10, I shall
only remark that Scherner has noticed in this connection
that the human body represents a building.
<q>Well built house</q> signifies <q>beautiful body.</q>
</p>

<p>
If we remember that the wanderer reverses the
way of birth, we shall not be surprised that he finds
a smaller garden in the larger. That is probably
the uterus. The wanderer attains the most intimate
union with his ideal, the mother, in imagining himself
in her body. This phantasy is continued still
less ambiguously,&mdash;but I do not wish to anticipate.
Be it only said: He possesses his mother as a spouse
and as a child; it is as if in the desire to do everything
better than his father he desires to beget himself
anew. We already know the mythological motives
of new creation, that should follow the forcible
separation of the parents and that we have not yet
<pb n="094"/><anchor id="Pg094"/>
noticed in the parable. Shall the better world still
be created, the dismembered paternal power be renewed,
the lion again be brought to life?
</p>

<p>
The rectangular place in the garden suggests a
grave. A wall in a dream means, among other
things, a cemetery wall and the garden, a cemetery.
And widely as these ideas may be contrasted with
the lifegiving mother's womb, they yet belong psychologically
in very close connection with her. And
perhaps not only psychologically.
</p>

<p>
Stekel tells a dream of Mrs. Delta in which occurs
<q>an open square space, a garden or court. In
the corner stood a tree, that slowly sinks before our
eyes as if it were sinking in water. As the tree and
the court also made swinging motions, I cleverly remarked,
<q>Thus we see how the change in the
earth's surface takes place.</q></q> The topmost psychic
stratum of the dream reveals itself as an earthquake
reminiscence. <q>Earth</q> leads to the idea of
<q>Mother Earth.</q> The tree sinking into it, is the
tree of life, the phallus. The rectangular space is
the bedroom, the marriage bed. The swinging motions
characterize the whole picture still better.
The earthquake, however, contains, as is found in
the analysis, death thoughts also. The rectangular
space becomes a grave. Even the water of the
dream deserves notice. <q>Babies come out of the
water,</q> says an infantile theory of procreation.
We learn later that the fœtus floats in amniotic
liquor. This <q>water</q> lies naturally in <q>Mother
Earth.</q> In contrast we have the water of the dead
<pb n="095"/><anchor id="Pg095"/>
(river of the dead, islands of the dead, etc.). Both
waters are analogous in the natural symbolism. It
is the mythical abode of the people not yet, or no
longer, to be found in the world.
</p>

<p>
As water will appear again at important points in
the parable, I will dwell a little longer on that topic.
</p>

<p>
Little children come out of Holla's fountain,
there are in German districts a number of Holla
wells or Holla springs (Holla brunn?) with appropriate
legends. Women, we are told, who step into
those springs become prolific. Mullenhof tells of
an old stone fountain in Flensburg, which is called
the Grönnerkeel. Its clear, copious water falls out
of four cocks into a wide basin and supplies a great
part of the city. The Flensburgers hold this fountain
in great honor, for in this city it is not the stork
which brings babies, but they are fished out of this
fountain. While fishing the women catch cold and
therefore have to stay in bed. Bechstein (Fränk.
Sagensch.) mentions a Little Linden Spring on a
road in Schweinfurt near Königshofen. The nurses
dip the babies out of it with silver pails, and it flows
not with water but with milk. If the little ones come
to this baby fountain they look through the holes of
the millstone (specially mentioned on account of
what follows) at its still water, that mirrors their
features, and think they have seen a little brother
or sister that looks just like them. (Nork. Myth d.
Volkss., p. 501.)
</p>

<p>
From the lower Austrian peasantry Rank takes
the following (Wurth. Zf. d. Mythol., IV, 140):
<pb n="096"/><anchor id="Pg096"/>
<q>Far, far off in the sea there stands a tree near
which the babies grow. They hang by a string on
the tree and when the baby is ripe the string breaks
and the baby floats off. But in order that it should
not drown, it is in a box and in this it floats away to
the sea until it comes into a brook. Now our Lord
God makes ill a woman for whom he intended the
baby. So a doctor is summoned. Our Lord God
has already suggested to him that the sick woman
will have a baby. So he goes out to the brook and
watches for a long time until finally the box with the
baby comes floating in, and he takes it up and brings
it to the sick woman. And this is the way all people
get their babies.</q>
</p>

<p>
I call attention briefly also to the legend of the
fountain of youth, to the mythical and naturalistic
ideas of water as the first element and source of all
life, and to the drink of the gods (soma, etc.)
Compare also the fountain in the verses previously
quoted.
</p>

<p>
The bridal pair in the parable (Sec. 11) walk
through the garden and the bride says they intend
in their chamber to <q>enjoy the pleasures of love.</q>
They have picked many fragrant roses. Bear in
mind the picking of strawberries in Mr. T.'s dream.
The garden becomes a bridal chamber. The rain
mentioned somewhat earlier, is a fructifying rain;
it is the water of life that drops down upon Mother
Earth. It is identical with the sinking trees of Mrs.
Delta's dream, with the power of creation developed
by the wanderer, with the mythical drink of the gods,
<pb n="097"/><anchor id="Pg097"/>
ambrosia, soma. We shall now see the wanderer
ascend or descend to the source of this water of
life. To gain the water of life it is generally in
myths necessary to go down into the underworld
(Ishtar's Hell Journey), into the belly of a monster
or the like. Remember, too, that the wanderer puts
himself back in his mother's womb. There is indeed
the origin of his life. The process is still more
significantly worked out in the parable.
</p>

<p>
The wanderer (Section 11, after the garden episode)
comes to the mill. The water of the mill
stream also plays a significant part in the sequel.
The reader will surely have already recognized what
kind of a mill, what kind of water is meant. I will
rest satisfied with the mere mention of several facts
from folklore and dream-life.
</p>

<p>
Nork (Myth. d. Volkss., p. 301 f.) writes that
Fenja is of the female sex in the myth (Horwendil)
which we must infer from her occupation, for
in antiquity when only hand mills were as yet in use,
women exclusively did this work. In symbolic language,
however, the mill signifies the female organ
(μυλλός from which comes <hi rend='italic'>mulier</hi>) and as the man
is the miller, the satirist Petronius uses <hi rend='italic'>molere
mulierem</hi> = (grind a woman) for coitus, and Theocritus
(Idyll, IV, 48) uses μύλλω (I grind) in the
same sense. Samson, robbed of his strength by the
harlot, has to grind in the mill (Judges XVI, 21) on
which the Talmud (Sota fol. 10) comments as follows:
By the grinding is always meant the sin of
fornication (Beischlaf). Therefore all the mills
<pb n="098"/><anchor id="Pg098"/>
in Rome stand still at the festival of the chaste
Vesta. Like Apollo, Zeus, too, was a miller
(μυλεύς, Lykophron, 435), but hardly a miller by
profession, but only in so far as he presides over the
creative lifegiving principle of the propagation of
creatures. It is now demonstrated that every man
is a miller and every woman a mill, from which alone
it may be conceived that every marriage is a milling
(jede Vermählung eine Vermehlung), etc. Milling
(vermehlung) is connected with the Roman confarreatio
(a form of marriage); at engagements the
Romans used to mingle two piles of meal. In the
same author (p. 303 and p. 530): Fengo is therefore
the personification of grinding, the mill
(Grotti) is his wife Gerutha, the mother of Amleth
or Hamlet. Grotti means both woman and mill.
Greeth is only a paraphrase of woman. He continues,
<q>Duke Otto, Ludwig of Bavaria's youngest
son, wasted his substance with a beautiful miller's
daughter named Margaret, and lived in Castle
Wolfstein.... This mill is still called the Gretel
mill and Prince Otto the Finner</q> (Grimm, D. S.,
No. 496). Finner means, like Fengo, the miller
[Fenja&mdash;old Norman? = the milleress], for the
marriage is a milling [Vermählung ist eine Vermehlung],
the child is the ground grain, the meal.
</p>

<p>
The same writer (Sitt. u. Gebr., p. 162): <q>In
concept the seed corn has the same value as the
spermatozoon. The man is the miller, the woman
the mill.</q>
</p>

<p>
In Dulaure-Krauss-Rieskel (Zeugung i. Glaub
<pb n="099"/><anchor id="Pg099"/>
usw. d. Völk., p. 100 ff.) I find the following charm
from the writings of Burkhard, Bishop of Worms:
<q>Have you not done what some women are accustomed
to do? They strip themselves of clothes,
they anoint their naked bodies with honey, spread
a cloth on the ground, on which they scatter grain,
roll about in it again and again, then collect carefully
all the grains, which have stuck on their bodies,
and grind them on the mill stone which they turn in
a contrary direction. When the corn is ground into
meal, they bake a loaf of it, and give it to their
husbands to eat, so that they become sick and die.
When you have done this you will atone for it forty
days on bread and water.</q>
</p>

<p>
Killing is the opposite of procreating, therefore
the mill is here turned in reverse direction.
</p>

<p>
Etymologically it is here to be noted that the verb
mahlen (grind), iterative form of môhen (mow),
originally had a meaning of moving oneself forwards
and backwards. Mulieren or mahlen
(grind), <hi rend='italic'>molere</hi>, μυλλειν for coire (cf. Anthropophyteia,
VIII, p. 14).
</p>

<p>
There are numerous stories where the mill appears
as the place of love adventures. The <q>old
woman's mill</q> also is familiar; old women go in
and come out young. They are, as it were, ground
over in the magic mill. The idea of recreation in
the womb lies at the bottom of it, just as in the
vulgar expression, <q>Lassen sie sich umvögeln.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a legend of the Transylvanian Gypsies, <q>there
came again an old woman to the king and said:
<pb n="100"/><anchor id="Pg100"/>
<q>Give me a piece of bread, for seven times already
has the sun gone down without my having eaten
anything!</q> The King replied: <q>Good, but I will
first have meal ground for you,</q> and he called his
servants and had the old woman sawn into pieces.
Then the old woman's sawn up body changed into a
good Urme (fairy) and she soared up into the
air....</q> (H. V. Wlislocki, Märchen u. Sagen
d. transylv. Zigeuner.)
</p>

<p>
A dream: <q>I came into a mill and into ever narrower
apartments till finally I had no more space.
I was terribly anxious and awoke in terror.</q> A
birth phantasy or uterus phantasy.
</p>

<p>
Another dream (Stekel, Spr. d. Tr., p. 398 f.):
<q>I came through a crack between two boards out
of the <q>wheel room.</q> The walls dripped with
water. Right before me is a brook in which stands
a rickety, black piano. I use it to cross over the
brook, as I am running away. Behind me is a
crowd of men. In front of them all is my uncle.
He encourages them to pursue me and roars and
yells. The men have mountain sticks, which they
occasionally throw at me. The road goes through
the verdure up and down hill. The path is strewn
with coal cinders and therefore black. I had to
struggle terribly to gain any ground. I had to push
myself to move forwards. Often I seemed as
though grown to the ground and the pursuers came
ever nearer. Suddenly I am able to fly. I fly into
a mill through the window. In it is a space with
board walls; on the opposite wall is a large crank.
<pb n="101"/><anchor id="Pg101"/>
I sit on the handle, hold on to it with my hands, and
fly up. When the crank is up I press it down with
my weight, and so set the mill in motion. While
so engaged I am quite naked. I look like a cupid.
I beg the miller to let me stay here, promising to
move the mill in the manner indicated. He sent me
away and I have to fly out of another window again.
Outside there comes along the <q>Flying Post.</q> I
place myself in front near the driver. I was soon
requested to pay, but I have only three heller with
me. So the conductor says to me, <q>Well, if you
can't pay, then you must put up with our sweaty
feet.</q> Now, as if by command, all the passengers
in the coach drew off a shoe and each held a sweaty
foot in front of my nose.</q>
</p>

<p>
This dream, too (beside other things), contains
a womb phantasy, wheel room, mill, space with wet
walls&mdash;the womb. The dreamer is followed by a
crowd; just as our wanderer is met by a crowd; the
elders. This dream, which will still further occupy
our attention, I shall call the <q>Flying Post.</q>
</p>

<p>
Let us return to the parable. The mill of Section
11 is the womb. The wanderer strives for the most
intimate union with his mother; his striving, to do
better than his father culminates in his procreating
himself, the son, again and better.
</p>

<p>
He will quite fill up his mother&mdash;be the father
in full. Of course the phantasy does not progress
without psychic obstructions. The anxious passage
over the narrow plank manifests it.
</p>

<p>
We have here the familiar obstructions to movement
<pb n="102"/><anchor id="Pg102"/>
and in a form indeed that recalls the dangerous
path on the wall. The passage over the water
is also a death symbol. We have not only the
anxiety about death caused by the moral conflict,
but we have also to remember that the passage into
the uterus is a passage to the beyond. The water
is the Water of Death (stygian waters) and of Life.
In narrower sense it is also seminal fluid and the
amniotic liquor. It is overdetermined as indeed all
symbols are. The water bears the death color =
black. In the Flying Post dream a black road appears.
The dreamer has conflicts like those of the
wanderer.
</p>

<p>
The old miller who will give no information is
the father. Of course he will not let him have his
mother, and he gives him no information as to the
mill work or the procreative activity. The wheels
are, on the one hand, the organs that grind out the
child (producing the child like meal), and on the
other hand they are the ten commandments whose
mundane administration is the duty of the father,
by means of strict education and punishment. In
passing over the plank, the wanderer places himself
above the ten commandments and above the privileges
of the father. The wanderer always extricates
himself successfully from the difficulties. The
anxiety is soon done away with, and the fulfillment
phase supervenes. It is only a faint echo of the paternal
commandments when the elders (immediately
after the episode, Section 11) hold out before him
the letter from the faculty. At bottom, in retaining
<pb n="103"/><anchor id="Pg103"/>
their authority, they do indeed go against his own
wishes (also a typical artifice of the dream technique).
</p>

<p>
I have already discussed the letter episode sufficiently
(as also Sections 12 and 13), so I need say
no more about the incest wish there expressed.
</p>

<p>
The bridal pair were put (Section 14) into their
crystal prison. We have been looking for the reassembling
of the dismembered; it takes place before
our eyes, the white and red parts, bones and blood,
are indeed bridegroom and bride. The prison is
the skin or the receptacle in which, as in myths, the
revivification takes place. Not in the sense of the
revivification of the annihilated father, but a recreation
(improvement) that the son accomplishes, although
the creative force as such remains the same.
The son <q>marries and mills</q> (vermählt und vermehlt)
with his mother, for the crystal container is
again the same as the mill; the uterus. Even the
amniotic fluid and the nutritive liquid for the fœtus
are present, and the wanderer remakes himself into
a splendid king. He can really do it better than his
father. The dream carries the wish fulfillment to
the uttermost limits.
</p>

<p>
Let us examine the process somewhat more in
detail. The wanderer, by virtue of a dissociation,
has a twofold existence, once as a youth in the inside
of the glass sphere, and once outside in his former
guise. Outside and inside he is united with his
mother as husband and as developing child. He
there embraces his <q>sister</q> (image of his mother
<pb n="104"/><anchor id="Pg104"/>
renewed with him as it were) as Osiris does his
sister Isis. And in addition to this the infantile
sexual components of exhibitionism find satisfaction,
for whose gratification the covering of the procreation
mystery is made of glass. The sexual influence
of the wanderer on the kettle (uterus) is symbolically
indicated by the fire task allotted to him. The
fire is one of the most frequent love symbols in
dreams. Language also is wont to speak of the fire
of love, of the consuming flames of passion, of ardent
desires, etc. Customs, in particular marriage
customs, show a similar symbolism. That the wanderer
is charged with a duty, and explicitly commanded
to do what he is willing to do without orders,
is again the already mentioned cunning device
of the dream technique to bring together the incompatible.
It seems almost humorous when the prison
is locked with the seal of the right honorable faculty;
I recall to you the expression <q>sealing</q> (petschieren);
the sealing is an applying of the father's
penis. In the place of father we find, of course, the
officiating wanderer. The sealing means, however,
the shutting up of the seed of life that is placed in
the mother. It is also said that the pair, after the
confinement in the prison, can be given no more
nourishment; and that the food with which they are
provided comes exclusively from the water of the
mill. That refers to the intrauterine nourishment,
to which nothing, of course, can be supplied but the
water of the mill so familiar to us.
</p>

<p>
The precious vessel that the wanderer guards is
<pb n="105"/><anchor id="Pg105"/>
surrounded by strong walls; it is inaccessible to the
others; he alone may approach with his fire. It is
winter. That is not merely a rationalizing (pretext
of commonplace argument) of the firing, but a
token of death entering into the uterus. The amorous
pair in the prison dissolve and perish, even rot
(Section 15). I must mention incidentally, for the
understanding of this version, that at the time of the
writing of the parable the process of impregnation
was associated with the idea of the <q>decaying</q> or
<q>rotting</q> of the semen. The womb is compared
to the earth in which the kernel of grain <q>decays.</q>
</p>

<p>
The decaying which precedes the arising of the
new being is connected with a great inundation.
Mythically, a deluge is actually accustomed to introduce
a (improved) creation. A proper myth can
hardly dispense with the idea of a primal flood. I
would, in passing, note that the present phase of the
parable corresponds mythologically to the motive
of being swallowed, the later release from the prison
is the spitting forth (from the jaws of the monster),
the return from the underworld. The dismemberment
motive of the cosmogonies is usually
associated with a deluge motive. In the description
of the flood in the parable there are, moreover, included
some traits of the biblical narrative, e.g., the
forty days and the rainbow. This, be it remarked
in passing, had appeared before; it is a sign of a
covenant. It binds heaven and earth, man and
woman. The flood originates in the falling of
tears; it arises also from the body of the woman; it
<pb n="106"/><anchor id="Pg106"/>
refers to the well known highly significant water.
Stekel has arranged for dreams the so-called symbolic
parallels, according to which all secretions and
excretions may symbolically represent each other.
On the presupposition that marks of similarity are
not conceived in a strict sense, the following comparisons
may be drawn: Mucus = blood = pus =
urine = stools = semen = milk = sweat = tears =
spirit = air = [breath = flatus] = speech = money
= poison. That in this comparison both souls and
tears appear is particularly interesting; the living or
procreating principle appears as soul in the form of
clouds. These are formed from water, the Water
of Life. The dew that comes from it impregnates
the earth.
</p>

<p>
As we have now reached the excreta, I should like
to remind the reader of the foul and stinking bodies
that in the parable lie in liquid (Section 15) on
which falls a warmer rain. The parable psychoanalytically
regarded, is the result of a regression
leading us into infantile thinking and feeling; we
have seen it clearly enough in the comparison with
the myths. And here it is to be noticed how great
an interest children take in the process of defecation.
I should not have considered this worthy of notice,
did not the hermetic symbolism, as we shall see later,
actually use in parallel cases the expressions <q>fimus,</q>
<q>urina puerorum,</q> etc., in quite an unmistakable
manner. In any case it is worth remembering that
out of dung and urine, things that decompose malodorously
and repulsively, fresh life arises. This
<pb n="107"/><anchor id="Pg107"/>
agrees with the infantile theory of procreation, that
babies are brought forth as the residue of assimilation;
we are to observe, however, still other interrelations
that will be encountered later. A series of
mythological parallels may be cited. I shall rest satisfied
with referring to the droll story, <q>Der Dumme
Hans.</q> Stupid Jack loads manure (fæces, sewage)
into a cart and goes with it to a manor; there
he tells them he comes from the <hi rend='italic'>Moorish</hi> land (from
the country of the blacks) and carries in his barrel
the <hi rend='italic'>Water of Life</hi>. When any one opens the barrel
without permission, Stupid Jack represented himself
as having turned the water of life into sewage.
He repeated the little trick with his <emph>dead</emph> grandmother
whom he sewed up in black cloths and gave
out as a wonderfully beautiful princess who was lying
in a hundred years' sleep. Again, as he expected,
the covering was raised by an unbidden hand and
John lamented, that, on account of the interference,
instead of the princess, whom he wanted to take to
the King, a disgusting corpse had been magically substituted.
He succeeded in being recompensed with
a <emph>good deal</emph> of money. [Jos. Haltrich, Deut. Volksmed.
d. Siebenbürg, II, p. 224.]
</p>

<p>
Inasmuch as the wanderer of our parable finds
himself not outside but inside of the receptacle, he
is as if in a bath. I note incidentally that writings
analogous to the parable expressly mention a bath
in a similar place, as the parable also does (Sec. 15).
In dreams the image of bathing frequently appears
to occur as a womb or birth phantasy.
</p>

<pb n="108"/><anchor id="Pg108"/>

<p>
At the end of the 14th section, as the inmates of
the prison die, his certain ruin stands before the
wanderer's eyes&mdash;again a faint echo of his relation
to the bridegroom.
</p>

<p>
We have already for a long time thoroughly familiarized
ourselves with the thought that in the
crystal prison the revivification of the dismembered
comes to pass. Whoever has the slightest doubt
of it, can find it most beautifully shown in the beginning
of Section 15. The author of the parable
even mentions Medea and Æson. I need add nothing
more concerning the talents of the Colchian sorceress
in the art of dissection and rejuvenation.
</p>

<p>
In Section 18, <q>the sun shines very bright, and
the day becomes warmer than before and the dog
days are at hand.</q> Soon after (Sec. 19) the king
is released from prison. It was before the winter
(Sec. 14), but after that season, when the sun
<q>shines very warm</q> (Sec. 11), consequently well
advanced into autumn. Let us choose for the purpose
a middle point between the departing summer
and the approaching winter, about the end of October,
and bear in mind that the dog-days come in
August, so that at the end of July they are in waiting,
then we find for the time spent in the receptacle nine
months&mdash;the time of human gestation.
</p>

<p>
The newborn (Sec. 20) is naturally&mdash;thirsty.
What shall he be fed with if not with the water
from the mill? And the water makes him grow and
thrive.
</p>

<p>
Two royal personages stand before us in splendor
<pb n="109"/><anchor id="Pg109"/>
and magnificence. The wanderer has created for
himself new parents (the father-king is, of course,
also himself) corresponding to the family romance
of neurotics, a phantasy romance, that like a ghost
stalks even in the mental life of healthy persons.
It is a wish phantasy that culminates in its most outspoken
form in the conviction that one really springs
from royal or distinguished stock and has merely
been found by the actual parents who do not fit.
They conceal his true origin. The day will come,
however, when he will be restored to the noble station
which belongs to him by right. Here belong
in brief, those unrestrained wish phantasies which,
no matter in what concrete form, diversify the
naïvely outlined content. They arise from dissatisfaction
with surroundings and afford the most agreeable
contrasts to straitened circumstances or poverty.
In the parable especially, the King (in his father
character) is attractively portrayed.
</p>

<p>
At first the <q>lofty appearance</q> (Sec. 19) of the
severe father amazes the wanderer, then it turns
out, however, that the king (ideal father) is friendly,
gracious and meek, and we are assured that <q>nothing
graces exalted persons as much as these virtues.</q>
And then he leads the wanderer into his kingdom
and allows him to enjoy all the merely earthly
treasures. There takes place, so to speak, a universal
gratification of all wishes.
</p>

<p>
Mythologically we should expect that the hero
thrown up from the underworld, should have
brought with him the drink of knowledge. This is
<pb n="110"/><anchor id="Pg110"/>
actually the case, as he has indeed gained the thing
whose constitution is metaphorically worked out in
the whole story, that is, the philosopher's stone.
The wanderer is a true soma robber.
</p>

<p>
Let us hark back to the next to last section.
Here, near the end of the dream, the King becomes
sleepy. The real sleeper already feels the approaching
awakening and would like to sleep longer (to
phantasy). But he pretends that the king is sleepy,
thus throwing the burden from his own shoulders.
And to this experience is soon attached a symbol of
waking: the wanderer, the dreamer of the parable,
is taken to another land, indeed into a bright land.
He wakes from his dreams with a pious echo of his
wish fulfillment on his lips ... <q>to which end
help us, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Amen.</q>
It is quite prosaic to conclude this melodious finale
by means of the formula <q>threshold symbolism.</q>
</p>

<p>
To sum up in a few words what the parable contains
from the psychoanalytic point of view, and to
do this without becoming too general in suggesting
as its results the universal fulfillment of all wishes,
I should put it thus: the wanderer in his phantasy
removes and improves the father, wins the mother,
procreates himself with her, enjoys her love even in
the womb and satisfies besides his infantile curiosity
while observing procreative process from the outside.
He becomes King and attains power and magnificence,
even superhuman abilities.
</p>

<p>
Possibly one may be surprised at so much absurdity.
One should reflect, however, that those
<pb n="111"/><anchor id="Pg111"/>
unconscious titanic powers of imagination that, from
the innermost recesses of the soul set in motion the
blindly creating dream phantasy, can only wish and
do nothing but wish. They do not bother about
whether the wishes are sensible or absurd. Critical
power does not belong to them. This is the task of
logical thinking as we consciously exercise it, inasmuch
as we observe the wishes rising from the darkness
and compare and weigh them according to
teleological standards. The unconsciously impelling
affective life, however, desires blindly, and troubles
itself about nothing else.

The tradition of craftsmanship in metallurgy,
an art that was practiced from the earliest times, was
during the speculative period of human culture, saturated
with philosophy. Especially was this the case
in Egypt, where metallurgy, as the source of royal
riches and especially the methods of gold mining and
extraction, were guarded as a royal secret. In the
Hellenistic period the art of metal working, knowledge
of which has spread abroad and in which the
interest had been raised to almost scientific character,
was penetrated by the philosophical theories
of the Greeks: the element and atom ideas of the
nature-philosophers and of Plato and of Aristotle,
and the religious views of the neoplatonists. The
magic of the orient was amalgamated with it, Christian
elements were added&mdash;in brief, the content of
the chemistry of that time, which mainly had metallurgy
as its starting point, took a vital part in the
hybrid thought of syncretism in the first centuries
after Christ.
</p>

<p>
As the chemical science (in alchemy, alkimia, al
is the Arabic article prefixed to the Greek χημεία)
has come to us from the Arabs (Syrians, Jews, etc.)
it was long believed that it had an Arabian origin.
<pb n="113"/><anchor id="Pg113"/>
Yet it was found later that the Arabs, while they
added much of their own to it, still were but the
preservers of Greek-Hellenistic knowledge and we
are convinced that the alchemists were right when
they indicated in their traditions the legendary
Egyptian Hermes as their ancestor. This legendary
personage is really the Egyptian god Thoth,
who was identified with Hermes in the time of the
Ptolemies. He was honored as the Lord of the
highest wisdom and it was a favorite practice to
assign to him the authorship of philosophical and
especially of theological works. Hermes' congregations
were formed to practice the cult, and they
had their special Hermes literature.<note place='foot'>Information
on this point will be found in Reitzenstein's <q>Poimandres.</q></note> In later
times the divine, regal, Hermes figure was reduced to
that of a magician. When I speak, in what follows,
of the hermetic writings I mean (following the above
mentioned traditions) the alchemic writings, with,
however, a qualification which will be mentioned
later.
</p>

<p>
The idea of the production of gold was so dominant
in alchemy that it was actually spoken of as the
gold maker's art. It meant the ability to make gold
out of baser material, particularly out of other
metals. The belief in it and in the transmutability
of matter was by no means absurd, but rather it must
be counted as a phase in the development of human
thought. As yet unacquainted with the modern doctrine
of unchangeable elements they could draw no
<pb n="114"/><anchor id="Pg114"/>
other conclusion from the changes in matter which
they daily witnessed. If they prepared gold from
ores or alloys, they thought they had <q>made</q> it.
By analogy with color changes (which they produced
in fabrics, glass, etc.) they could suppose that they
had colored (tinctured) the baser metals into gold.
</p>

<p>
Under philosophical influences the doctrine arose
that metals, like human beings, had body and soul,
the soul being regarded as a finer form of corporeality.
They said that the soul or primitive stuff
(prima materia) was common to all metals, and in
order to transmute one metal into another they had
to produce a tincture of its soul. In Egypt lead,
under the name Osiris, was thought to be the primitive
base of metals; later when the still more plastic
quicksilver (mercury) was discovered, they regarded
this as the soul of metals. They thought
they had to fix this volatile soul by some medium in
order to get a precious metal, silver, gold.
</p>

<p>
That problematic medium, which was to serve to
tincture or transmute the baser metal or its mercury
to silver or gold, was called the Philosopher's
stone. It had the power to make the sick (base)
metal well (precious). Here came in the idea of
a universal medicine. Alchemy desired indeed to
produce in the Philosopher's Stone a panacea that
should free mankind of all sufferings and make men
young.
</p>

<p>
It will not be superfluous to mention here, that
the so-called materials, substances, concepts, are
found employed in the treatises of the alchemists in
<pb n="115"/><anchor id="Pg115"/>
a more comprehensive sense, we can even say with
more lofty implications, the more the author in question
leans to philosophical speculation. The authors
who indulged the loftiest flights were indeed
most treasured by the alchemists and prized as the
greatest masters. With them the concept mercury,
as element concept, is actually separated from that
of common quicksilver. On this level of speculation,
quicksilver (Hg.) is no longer considered as a
primal element, but as a suprasensible principle to
which only the name of quicksilver, mercury, is
loaned. It is emphasized that the <hi rend='italic'>mercurius philosophorum</hi>
may not be substituted for common quicksilver.
Similar transmutations are effected by the
concept of a primal element specially separated from
mercury. Prima materia is the cause of all objects.
Also the material from which the philosopher's
stone is produced is in later times called the prima
materia, accordingly in a certain sense, the raw material
(materia cruda) for its production. But I
anticipate; this belongs properly to the occidental
flourishing period of the alchemy of scholasticism.
</p>

<p>
A very significant and ancient idea in alchemy is
that of sprouting and procreation. Metals grow
like plants, and reproduce like animals. We are assured
by the adepts (those who had found it, viz.,
the panacea) in the Greek-Egyptian period and also
later, that gold begets gold as the corn does corn,
and man, man. The practice connected with this
idea consists in putting some gold in the mixture that
is to be transmuted. The gold dissolves like a seed
<pb n="116"/><anchor id="Pg116"/>
in it and is to produce the fruit, gold. The gold
ingredient was also conceived as a ferment, which
permeates the whole mixture like a leaven, and, as it
were, made it ferment into gold. Furthermore, the
tincturing matter was conceived as male and the matter
to be colored as female. Keeping in view the
symbol of the corn and seed, we see that the matter
into which the seed was put becomes earth and
mother, in which it will germinate in order to come
to fruition.
</p>

<p>
In this connection belongs also the ancient alchemic
symbol of the philosopher's egg. This symbol
is compared to the <q>Egyptian stone,</q> and the
dragon, which bites its tail; consequently the procreation
symbol is compared to an eternity or cycle
symbol. The <q>Egyptian stone</q> is, however, the
philosopher's stone or, by metonomy, the great work
(magnum opus) of its manufacture. The egg is
the World Egg that recurs in so many world cosmogonies.
The grand mastery refers usually and
mainly to thoughts of world creation. The egg-shaped
receptacle in which the master work was to
be accomplished was also known as the <q>philosophical
egg</q> in which the great masterpiece is produced.
This vessel was sealed with the magic seal of
Hermes; therefore hermetically sealed.
</p>

<p>
A wider theoretical conception, originating with
the Arabs, is the doctrine of the two principles.
They were retained in the subsequent developments
and further expanded. Ibn Sina [Avicenna, 980-ca.
1037] taught that every metal consisted of mercury
<pb n="117"/><anchor id="Pg117"/>
and sulphur. Naturally they do not refer to
the ordinary quicksilver and ordinary sulphur.
</p>

<p>
From the Arabs alchemy came to the occident and
spread extraordinarily. Among prominent authors
the following may be selected: Roger Bacon, Albertus
Magnus, Vincent of Beauvais, Arnold of
Villanova, Thomas Aquinas, Raymond Lully, etc.
</p>

<p>
The amount of material that could be adduced is
enormous. It is not necessary, however, to consider
it. What I have stated about the beginnings of
alchemy is sufficient in amount to enable the reader
to understand the following exposition of the alchemic
content of the parable. And what I must
supply in addition to the alchemic theories of the
time of their prevalence in the west, the reader will
learn incidentally from the following analysis.
</p>

<p>
In concluding this preliminary view I must still
mention one novelty that Paracelsus (1493-1541)
introduced into the theory. Ibn Sina had taught
that two principles entered into the constitution of
metals. Mercury is the bearer of the metallic property
and sulphur has the nature of the combustible
and is the cause of the transmutation of metals in fire.
The doctrine of the two principles leads to the theory
that for the production of gold it was necessary to
get from metals the purest possible sulphur and mercury,
in order to produce gold by the union of both.
Paracelsus now adds to the two principles a third,
salt, as the element of fixedness or palpability, as he
terms it. According to my notion, Paracelsus has
not introduced an essential innovation, but only used
<pb n="118"/><anchor id="Pg118"/>
in a new systematic terminology what others said
before him, even if they did not follow it out so consistently.
The principles mercury, sulphur and salt&mdash;their
symbols are [Symbol: Mercury], [Symbol: Sulphur] and [Symbol: Salt]&mdash;were among
the followers of the alchemists very widely used in
their technical language. They were frequently
also called spirit, soul and body. They were taken
in threes but also as before in twos, according to the
exigencies of the symbolism.
</p>

<p>
The alchemists' usual coupling of the planets with
metals is probably due to the Babylonians. I reproduce
these correspondences here in the form they
generally had in alchemy. I must beg the reader to
impress them upon his memory, as alchemy generally
speaks of the metals by their planetary names. According
to the ancient view (even if not the most
ancient) there are seven planets (among which was
the sun) and seven metals.

</table>

<p>
Relative to the technical language, which I must
use in the following discussion also, I have to make
a remark of general application that should be carefully
remembered. It is a peculiarity of the alchemistic
<pb n="119"/><anchor id="Pg119"/>
authors to use interchangeably fifty or more
names for a thing and on the other hand to give
one and the same name many meanings. This custom
was originally caused partly by the uncertainty
of the concepts, which has been mentioned above.
But this uncertainty does not explain why, in spite of
increase of knowledge, the practice was continued and
purposely developed. We shall speak later of the
causes that were active there. Let it first be understood
merely that it was the case and later be it explained
how it comes about that we can find our way
in the hermetic writings in spite of the strange freedom
of terminology that confuses terms purposely
and constantly. Apart from a certain practice in
the figurative language of the alchemists, it is necessary,
so to speak, to think independently of the words
used and regard them only in their context. For
example, when it is written that a body is to be
washed with water, another time with soap, and a
third time with mercury, it is not water and soap and
mercury that is the main point but the relation of
all to each other, that is the washing and on closer
inspection of the connection it can be deduced that
all three times the same cleansing medium is meant,
only described three times with different names.
</p>

<p>
The alchemistic interpretation of our parable is a
development of what its author tried to teach by it.
We do not need to show that he pursues an hermetic
aim, for he says so himself, and so do the circumstances,
i.e., the book, in which the parable is found.
In this respect we shall fare better in the alchemistic
<pb n="120"/><anchor id="Pg120"/>
exposition than in the psychoanalytic, where we were
aiming at the unconscious. Now we have the conscious
aim before us and we advance with the author,
while before we worked as it were against his understanding,
and deduced from the product of his
mind things that his conscious personality would
hardly admit, if we had him living before us; in
which case we should be instructing him and informing
him of the interpretation afforded by psychoanalysis.
</p>

<p>
In one respect we are therefore better off, but in
another we are much worse off. For the matter in
which we previously worked, the unconscious, remains
approximately the same throughout great periods;
the unconscious of the wanderer is in its fundamentals
not very different from that of a man of
to-day or from that of Zosimos. [Zosimos is one
of the oldest alchemistic writers of whom we have
any definite knowledge&mdash;about the 4th century.]
It is the soul of the race that speaks, its <q>humanity.</q>
Much more swiftly, on the contrary, does objective
knowledge change in the course of time and the
forms also in which this knowledge is expressed.
From this point of view the conscious is more difficult
of access than the unconscious. And now we
have to face a system so very far removed from our
way of thinking as the alchemistic.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately I need not regard it as my duty to
explain the parable so completely in the alchemistic
sense that any one could work according to it in a
chemical laboratory. It is much more suitable to
<pb n="121"/><anchor id="Pg121"/>
our purpose if I show in general outline only how we
must arrange the leading forms and processes of the
parable to accord with the mode of thinking peculiar
to alchemy. If I should succeed in doing so clearly,
we should already have passed a difficult stage.
Then for the first time I might venture further&mdash;to
the special object of this research. But patience!
We have not yet gone so far.
</p>

<p>
First of all it will be necessary for me to draw
in a few lines a sketch of how, in the most flourishing
period of alchemy, the accomplishment of the
Great Work was usually described. In spite of the
diversity of the representations we find certain fundamental
principles which are in general firmly established.
I will indicate a few points of this iron-clad
order in the alchemic doctrine.
</p>

<p>
There is, in the first place, the central idea of the
interaction or the coöperation of two things that are
generally called man and woman, red and white, sun
and moon, sulphur and mercury. We have already
seen in Ibn Sina that the metals consist of the combination
of sulphur and mercury. Even earlier the
interaction of two parts were figuratively called impregnation.
Both fuse into one symbol, and indeed
so much the more readily, as it probably arose as the
result of analogous thoughts, determined by a sexual
complex. Also there occurs the idea that we must
derive a male activity from the gold, a female from
the silver, in order to get from their union that which
perfects the mercury of the metals. That may be
the reason that, for the above mentioned pair that
<pb n="122"/><anchor id="Pg122"/>
is to be united, the denotation gold and silver
([Symbol: Gold] and [Symbol: Silver]) prevailed. Red and white = man and
woman (male and female activity), we found in the
parable also when studied psychoanalytically.
</p>

<p>
In the <q>Turba philosophorum</q> <q>the woman is
called Magnesia, the white, the man is called red,
sulphur.</q>
</p>

<p>
Morienus says. <q>Our stone is like the creation
of man. For first we have the union, 2, the corruption
[i.e., the putrefaction of the seed], 3, the gestation,
4, the birth of the child, 5, the nutrition
follows.</q>
</p>

<p>
Both constituents come from one root. Therefore
the authors inform us that the stone is an only
one. If we call the matter <q>mercury,</q> we therefore
generally speak of a doubled mercury that yet is
only one.
</p>

<p>
Arnold (Ros., II, 17): <q>So it clearly appears
that the philosophers spoke the truth about it, although
it seems impossible to simpletons and fools,
that there was indeed only one stone, one medicine,
one regulation, one work, one vessel, both identical
with the white and red sulphur, and to be made at
the same time.</q>
</p>

<p>
Id. (Ros., I, 6): <q>For there is only one stone,
one medicine, to which nothing foreign is added and
nothing taken away except that one separates the
superfluities from it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Herein lies the idea of purification or washing; it
occurs again. Arnold (Ros., II, 8): <q>Now when
you have separated the elements, then wash them.</q>
</p>

<pb n="123"/><anchor id="Pg123"/>

<p>
The idea of washing is connected with that of mechanical
purification, trituration, dismemberment in
the parable, grinding (mill), and with the bath and
solution (dissolution of the bridal pair). <q>Bath</q>
is, on the other hand, the surrounding vessel, water
bath. Arnold (Ros., I, 9): <q>The true beginning,
therefore, is the dissolution and solution of the
stone.</q> Fire can also cause a dissolution, either by
fusion or by a trituration that is similar to calcination.
They are all processes that put the substances
in question into its purest or chemically most accessible
form.
</p>

<p>
Arnold (Ros., I, 9): <q>The philosophical work
is to dissolve and melt the stone into its mercury, so
that it is reduced and brought back to its prima materia,
i.e., original condition, purest form.</q>
</p>

<p>
Through the opening of the single substance the
two things or seeds, red and white, are obtained.
</p>

<p>
But what is the <q>subject</q> that is put through
these operations, the matter that must be so worked
out? That is exactly what the alchemists most conceal.
They give the prima materia (raw material)
a hundred names, every one of which is a riddle.
They give intimations of interpretations but are not
willing to be definite. Only the worthy will find the
keys to the whole work. The rest of the procedure
can be understood only by one that knows the prima
materia. Much is written on it and its puzzling
names. They are, partly as raw material, partly as
original material, partly as prime condition, called
among other names Lapis philosophicus (philosopher's
<pb n="124"/><anchor id="Pg124"/>
stone), aqua vitæ (water of life), venenum
(poison), spiritus (spirit), medicina (medicine),
cœlum (sky), nubes (clouds), ros (dew), umbra
(shadow), stella signata (marked star), and Lucifer,
Luna (moon), aqua ardens (fiery water),
sponsa (betrothed), coniux (wife), mater, mother
(Eve),&mdash;from her princes are born to the king,&mdash;virgo
(virgin), lac virginis (virgin's milk), menstruum,
materia hermaphrodita catholica Solis et
Lunae (Catholic hermaphrodite matter of sun and
moon), sputum Lunae (moon spittle), urina puerorum
(children's urine), fæces dissolutæ (loose
stool), fimus (muck), materia omnium formarum
(material of all forms), Venus.
</p>

<p>
It will be evident to the psychoanalyst that the
original material is occasionally identified with secretions
and excretions, spittle, milk, dung, menstruum,
urine. These correspond exactly to the infantile
theories of procreation, as does the fact that
these theories come to view where the phantasy
forms symbols in its primitive activity. It is also
to be noticed that countless alchemic scribblers who
did not understand the works of the <q>masters</q>
worked with substances like urine, semen, spittle,
dung, blood, menstruum, etc., where the dim idea of
a procreative essence in these things came into play.
I will have something to say on this subject in connection
with the Homunculus. I should meanwhile
like to refer to the close relationship of excrement
and gold in myth and folklore. [Cf. <ref target="Note_B">Note B</ref> at the
end of this volume.] It is clear that for the art of
<pb n="125"/><anchor id="Pg125"/>
gold production this mythological relationship is of
importance.
</p>

<p>
To the action of analyzing substances before the
reassembling or rebuilding, besides washing and
trituration, belongs also putrefaction or rotting.
Without this no fruitful work is possible. I have
previously mentioned that it was thought that semen
must rot in order to impregnate. The seed grain is
subject to putrefaction in the earth. But we must
remember also the impregnating activity of manure
if we wish to understand correctly and genetically the
association rot&mdash;procreate. Putrefaction is one of
the forms of corruption (= breaking up) and corruptio
unius est generatio alterius (the breaking up
of one is the begetting of another).
</p>

<p>
Arnold (Ros., I, 9): <q>In so far as the substances
here do not become incorporeal or volatile, so
that there is no more substance [as such therefore
destroyed] you will accomplish nothing in your
work.</q>
</p>

<p>
The red man and the white woman, called also
red lions and white lilies, and many other names, are
united and cooked together in a vessel, the philosophical
Egg. The combined material becomes
thereby gradually black (and is called raven or
ravenhead), later white (swan); now a somewhat
greater heat is applied and the substance is sublimated
in the vessel (the swan flies up); on further
heating a vivid play of colors appears (peacock tail
or rainbow); finally the substance becomes red and
that is the conclusion of the main work. The red
<pb n="126"/><anchor id="Pg126"/>
substance is the philosopher's stone, called also our
king, red lion, grand elixir, etc. The after work is
a subsequent elaboration by which the stone is given
still more power, <q>multiplied</q> in its efficiency.
Then in <q>projection</q> upon a baser metal it is able
to tincture immense amounts of it to gold. [In the
stage of projection the red tincture is symbolized as
a pelican. The reason for this will be given later.]
If the main work was interrupted at the white stage,
instead of waiting for the red, then they got the
white stone, the small elixir, with which the base
metals can be turned into silver alone.
</p>

<p>
We have spoken just now of the main work and
the after work. I mention for completeness that the
trituration and purification, etc., of the materials,
which precedes the main work, is called the fore
work. The division is, however, given in other
ways besides.
</p>

<p>
Armed with this explanation we can venture to
look for the alchemic hieroglyphs in our parable. I
must beg the reader to recall the main episodes.
</p>

<p>
In the wanderer we have to conceive of a man who
has started out to learn the secret of the great work.
He finds in the forest contradictory opinions. He
has fallen deep into errors. The study, although
difficult, holds him fast. He cannot turn back (Sec.
1). So he pursues his aim still further (Sec. 2) and
thinks he has now found the right authorities (Sec.
3) that can admit him to the college of wisdom.
But the people are not at one with each other.
They also employ figurative language that obscures
<pb n="127"/><anchor id="Pg127"/>
the true doctrine, and which, contrasted with practice,
is of no value. (I mention incidentally that
the great masters of the hermetic art are accustomed
to impress on the reader that he is not to cling to
their words but measure things always according to
nature and her possibilities.) The elders promise
him indeed the revelation of important doctrines but
are not willing to communicate the beginning of the
work (Sec. 5, 6, preparation for the fight with the
lion). That is a rather amusing trait of hermetic
literature.
</p>

<p>
We have come to the fight with the lion, which
takes place in a den. The wanderer kills the lion
and takes out of him red blood and white bones,
therefore red and white. Red and white enter later
as roses, then as man and woman.
</p>

<p>
I cite now several passages from different alchemistic
books.
</p>

<p>
Hohler (Herm. Phil., p. 91) says, apparently
after Michael Meiers, <q>Septimana Philosophica</q>:
<q>The green lion [a usual symbol for the material
at the beginning] encloses the raw seeds, yellow
hairs adorn his head [this detail is not lacking in the
parable], i.e., when the projection on the metals
takes place, they turn yellow, golden.</q> [Green is the
color of hope, of growth. Previously only the head
of the lion is gold, his future. Later he becomes a
red lion, the philosopher's stone, the king in robe of
purple. At any rate he must first be killed.]
</p>

<p>
The lion that must die is the dragon, which the
dragon fighter kills. Thus we have seen it in the
<pb n="128"/><anchor id="Pg128"/>
mythological parallel. Psychoanalysis shows us
further that lion = dragon = father (= parents,
etc.). It is now very interesting that the alchemistic
symbolism interchanges the same forms. We
shall see that again.
</p>

<p>
Berthelot cites (Orig. de l'Alch., p. 60) from an
old manuscript: <q>The dragon is the guardian of
the temple. Sacrifice it, flay it, separate the flesh
from the bones, and you will find what you seek.</q>
</p>

<p>
The dragon is, as can be shown out of the old
authors, also the snake that bites its own tail or
which on the other hand can also be represented by
two snakes.
</p>

<p>
Flamel writes on the hieroglyphic figure of two
dragons (in the 3d chapter of his Auslegung d.
hierogl. Fig.) the following: <q>Consider well
these two dragons for they are the beginning of the
philosophy [alchemy] which the sages have not
dared to show their own children.... The first is
called sulphur or the warm and dry. The other is
called quicksilver or the cold and wet. These are
the sun and the moon. These are snakes and dragons,
which the ancient Egyptians painted in the form
of a circle, each biting the other's tail, in order to
teach that they spring of and from one thing [our
lion!]. These are the dragons that the old poets
represent as guarding sleeplessly the golden apples
in the garden of the Hesperian maidens. These are
the ones to which Jason, in his adventures of the
golden fleece, gave the potion prepared for him by
the beautiful Medea. [See my explanation of the
<pb n="129"/><anchor id="Pg129"/>
motive of dismemberment] of which discourses the
books of the philosophers are so full that there has
not been a single philosopher, from the true Hermes,
Trismegistus, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Artephias,
Morienus, and other followers up to my own time,
who has not written about these matters. These are
the two serpents sent by Juno (who is the metallic
nature) that were to be strangled by the strong Hercules
(that is the sage in his cradle) [our wanderer],
that is to be conquered and killed in order to cause
them in the beginning of his work to rot, be destroyed
and be born. These are the two serpents
that are fastened around the herald's staff and rod
of Mercury.... Therefore when these two (which
Avicenna calls the bitch of Carascene and the dog
of Armenia) are put together in the vessel of the
grave, they bite each other horribly. [See the battle
of the sons of the dragon's teeth with Jason, the
elders in the parable, but also the embrace of the
bridal pair and the mythological parallels wrestling
= dragon fight = winning the king's daughter,...
= incest = love embrace or separation of the primal
parents, etc....] ... A corruption [destruction]
and putrefaction must take place before the renewal
in a better form. These are the two male and
female seed that are produced ... in the kidneys
and intestines ... of the four elements.</q>
</p>

<p>
The dragon, who is killed at the beginning of the
work, is also called Osiris by the old alchemists.
We are now acquainted with his dismemberment,
also his relation to lead ore. Flamel calls the vessel
<pb n="130"/><anchor id="Pg130"/>
of the alchemistic operation a <q>grave.</q> Olympiodorus
speaks in an alchemistic work of the grave
of Osiris. Only the face of Osiris, apparently
wrapped up like a mummy, is visible. In the parable
only the head of the lion is golden. The head
as the part preserved from the killing [dismemberment]
stands probably for the organ of generation.
The phallus is indeed exactly what produces the procreating
substance, semen. The phallus is the future.
The phallus was consecrated by Isis as a
memorial.
</p>

<p>
Janus Lacinius gives in his Pretiosa Margarita
the following allegory. In the palace sits the king
decorated with the diadem and in his hand the
scepter of the whole world. Before him appears
his son with five servants and falling at his feet implores
him to give the kingdom to him and the servants.
[The author takes the thing wrong end to.
The gold, king, is assailed by the other six metals,
because they themselves wish to be gold. The king
is killed. Essentially the same thing happens as
above.] Then the son in anger, and at the instigation
of his companions, kills his father on the throne.
He collects the father's blood in his garment. A
grave [the lion's den, the grave] is dug, into which
the son intends to throw the father, but they both
fall in. [Cf. the dangerous walk of the wanderer
on the wall, Section 8, where the people fall off.]
The son makes every effort to get out again, but some
one comes who does not permit it. [Symbolism of
obstruction, the locked door, etc., in the parable.
<pb n="131"/><anchor id="Pg131"/>
The grave changes imperceptibly into the vessel
where the bridal pair&mdash;with Lacinius they are father
and son instead of mother and son&mdash;are united
and securely locked in.] When the whole body is
dissolved the bones are thrown out of the grave.
They are divided into nine [dismemberment], the
dissolved substance is cooked nine days over a gentle
fire till the black appears. Again it is cooked nine
days until the water is bright and clear. The black,
with its water of life [in the parable the mill water
is black] is cooked nine days till the white earth of
the philosophers appears. An angel throws the
bones on the purified and whitened earth, which is
now mixed with its seeds. They are separated from
water in a strong fire. Finally the earth of the
bones becomes red like blood or ruby. Then the
king rises from his grave full of the grace of God,
quite celestial, with grand mien, to make all his servants
kings. He places golden crowns on the heads
of his son and the servants.
</p>

<p>
As bearers of both seeds, male and female, the
lion is androgynous. Actually the subject (i.e., the
first material) is conceived as twofold, bisexual. It
is called by names that mean the two sexes, it is also
called <q>hermaphrodite.</q> It is represented as rebis
(res bina = double thing), as a human with a male
and a female head standing on a dragon. From the
conquered dragon (lion) comes forth the Double.
The substance is also called Mercurius; his staff
bears the two antagonistic serpents mentioned by
Flamel. In the parable also appears an hermaphrodite,
<pb n="132"/><anchor id="Pg132"/>
the being (Sec. 8) which the wanderer cannot
distinguish, whether it be a man or a woman.
It is the original substance, Mercury, <q>our hermaphrodite.</q>
</p>

<p>
In Section 9 of the parable, and also later, red
and white appear in roses. The white and the red
tincture are often in alchemy compared to white and
red roses.
</p>

<p>
In Section 9 the wanderer comes to those houses
where people work alone or by twos. They work
in a slovenly fashion. The alchemistic quacks are
generally called <q>bunglers</q> and <q>messy cooks</q> by
the masters of the art. These are the ones who do
not work according to the <q>possibilities of nature,</q>
which is, nevertheless, the touchstone of all right production.
</p>

<p>
The garden (Sec. 10, 11) is one of the <q>rose gardens</q>
of which, e.g., the alchemist, Michael Meier,
likes to speak.
</p>

<p>
There are difficulties in uniting the red youths
with the white maidens. A wall separates them.
The wanderer removes the obstruction in unlocking
the door. That may indicate a chemical unlocking,
by which the bodies are chemically brought nearer
together.
</p>

<p>
The wanderer comes to a mill (Sec. 11). The
mill naturally indicates the already mentioned trituration
of the substance. It has, however, also reference
to fermentation and in particular to that by
means of meal.
</p>

<p>
Rulandus (Lex., pp. 211 ff., s. v. Fermentum):
<pb n="133"/><anchor id="Pg133"/>
<q>Ferment is elixir, leaven, or yeast as it is called;
it makes porous the body that swells up and the
spirit finds a place in it so that it becomes fit to bake.
As now the meal is not yeast, but meal and water
[mill water] and the whole dough is thoroughly
leavened and real yeast, so also the lapis [stone] is
itself the ferment, yet gold and mercury are also
called ferment.</q>
</p>

<p>
Now begins the main work&mdash;marriage, prison,
embrace, conception, birth, transfiguration&mdash;to
which the rest of the parable is devoted.
</p>

<p>
The prison is the philosophic egg. It is also
called <q>Athanor, a sieve, dunghill, bain-marie
(double cooker), a kiln, round ball, green lion,
prison, grave, brothel, vial, cucurbit.</q> It is just like
the belly and the womb, containing in itself the true,
natural warmth (to give life to our young king).
The warmth that is used must first be gentle, <q>like
that after the winter</q>; it must be stronger like the
sun in spring, in summer [cf. the seasons in our parable].
(Flamel, pp. 50 ff.)
</p>

<p>
Daustenius (Ros., VII): <q>... And this thing
can be a symbol of a woman's belly, which, when
she has conceived, will immediately close the
womb.</q>
</p>

<p>
Id. (Ros., VII): <q>Therefore, when you have
put them (the white woman and the red man) in
their vessel, then close it as fast as possible....</q>
[Seal of Hermes.]
</p>

<p>
Id. (Ros., VIII): <q>Therefore that you arrange
the substances right and fine, and regulate your
<pb n="134"/><anchor id="Pg134"/>
work well, and marry consanguineous matter with
masses acting consanguineously....</q> [Incest.]
</p>

<p>
Id. (Ros., VII): <q>So now this is our solution,
that you marry the Gabricum with the Beja, which
when he lies with the Beja, dies immediately and is
changed into her nature. Although the Beja is a
woman, still she improves the Gabricum because he
is come out of her.</q> [Death of the bridegroom son.
It should be remembered in this connection that all
metals or all substances generally&mdash;consequently
also the [Symbol: Sun]&mdash;come forth from the <q>mother,</q> the
primal substance [Symbol: Mercury].]
</p>

<p>
In a <q>Vision</q> of Daustenius, the king is to return
into his mother's womb in order to be procreated
afresh. The king <q>goes into his bedroom and
unexpectedly is fired with a great desire for coition,
and goes to sleep at once, and has lain with a surpassingly
beautiful maiden, who was a daughter of
his mother</q> [weakened form of mother incest].
Later the vision says, <q>The woman, however, incloses
her man, as a mother, quite carefully in the
innermost part of her body.</q>
</p>

<p>
The bodies inclosed in the vessel fall to pieces
and are partly volatile. The vapors [soul] return,
however, into the bodies. There conception
takes place.
</p>

<p>
Daustenius [Ros. IX.]: <q>... From that are airy
spirits come, that with each other rise into the air,
and there have conceived life, that is blown into
them by their dampness, as the human being has
life from air, by which it increases.... For life of
<pb n="135"/><anchor id="Pg135"/>
all natural things depends upon the blowing in of
air.</q>
</p>

<p>
The bestowing of life by a blowing in of air plays
a great part in myths. Also there occurs quite frequently
special impregnations by air and wind. It
is a primitive impregnation theory, that is found also
in the ideas of children.
</p>

<p>
Children think of the blowing in of air into the
anus as a natural sexual theory. I know several
cases where this practice is carried out with emphasis
on the erotic under the pretense of <q>playing doctor.</q>
A child once told what papa and mamma do
when they are alone; they put their naked backsides
together and blow air into each other.
</p>

<p>
Another infantile theory explains impregnation
by the swallowing of an object. In myths and fairy
lore this motive occurs with extraordinary frequency.
To the swallowing as conception, corresponds
defecation as parturition. Incidentally we
should note that the bodies in the philosophic egg
turn actually into a rolling, stinking, black mass,
which is expressly called dung by many authors.
The water is also called urine. The prima materia
is also called urine. In the philosophical egg the
white woman swallows the red man, man-eating
motive. (Stucken.)
</p>

<p>
Liber Apocal. Hermetis (Cited by Hohler, p.
105 f.): <q>... Therefore the philosophers have
married this tender young maiden to Gabricus, to
have them procreate fruit, and when Gabricus
sleeps he dies. The Beja [i.e., the white maiden]
<pb n="136"/><anchor id="Pg136"/>
has swallowed him and consumed him because of her
great love.</q>
</p>

<p>
Now as to the intra-uterine nourishment of the
fetus by means of the water of life:
</p>

<p>
Daustenius [Ros. vi.]: <q>... The fruit in the
womb is nourished only by the mother's blood.</q> Id.
(Ros. x):
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Without seeds no fruit can grow up for thee:</q></l>
<l>First the seed dies; then wilt thou see fruit.</l>
<l>In the stomach the food is cooked tender</l>
<l>From which the limbs draw the best to themselves.</l>
<l>When too the seed is poured into the womb</l>
<l>Then the womb stays right tenderly closed.</l>
<l>The menstruum does not fail the fruit for nourishment</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Till it at the proper time comes to the light of day.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
Later he says (Id., XI): <q>Lay the son by her
that she suckle him.</q> [The water of life is therefore
also the milk.]
</p>

<p>
The new king is born, and now he and his consort
appear in priceless garments (cf. Section 18 of
the parable). The color change of the substance
is expressed by means of the change of garments,
like peacock's tail, rainbow. The process goes from
black through gray to white, yellow, red, purple.
</p>

<p>
The end is reached with purple. The wanderer
at the end describes the virtues of the philosopher's
stone. We have already compared the great elixir
with soma. In the old alchemistic book, which bears
the name of the Persian magician, Osthanes (Berthelot,
Orig., p. 52), the divine water heals all maladies.
Water of life,&mdash;elixir of life.
</p>

<pb n="137"/><anchor id="Pg137"/>

<p>
Many readers will shake their heads over the
psychoanalytic exposition of the parable. The
gross development of sexuality and the Œdipus complex
may seem improbable to him. The alchemistic
hieroglyphic has now in unexpected manner shown
after all, that these surprising things were not read
into the parable by psychoanalysis, but rightly found
in it, even though psychoanalysis has not by any
means exhausted the contents of the parable. What
might at first have appeared to be bold conjecture,
as for example, killing of the father, incest with the
mother, the conception of the red blood and white
bones as man and woman, the excrementitious substance
as procreative, the prison as the uterus, has all
been shown to be in use as favorite figurative expression
among the alchemistic authors.
</p>

<p>
The alchemists like to dwell on the process of
procreation, and on infantile sexual theories. The
deep interest that they show in these matters, and
without which they would not have used them so
much in their hieroglyphics, the meaning that these
things must have, in order to be regarded as worthy
to illustrate the processes of the great work, and
finally, the meaning that in some form or other they
actually have in the emotional life of every man, all
of this makes it evident that the line of imaginative
speculations with which we have become acquainted,
deserves independent treatment. In practice there
was a fission, and procreation becomes an independent
problem for alchemists. Yet the followers of
the art did learn from nature, in order that their art
<pb n="138"/><anchor id="Pg138"/>
might follow the works of nature even to improve
on her; what wonder then if many of them set themselves
to the artificial creation&mdash;generation&mdash;of
man? Yet the belief in generatio equivoca has not
long been dead. Must it not have seemed somehow
possible, in view of the supposed fact that they saw
insects develop out of earth, worms out of dung, etc.,
that they should by special artificial interposition,
be able to make higher forms of life come out of
lifeless matter? And of all the substances not one
was indeed completely lifeless for the <q>animated</q>
metals even, grew and increased. In short, if we
regard the matter somewhat more closely, it is after
all not so extraordinary that they made serious attempts
to create the homunculus.
</p>

<p>
Generally Paracelsus is regarded as the author of
the idea, which to the somewhat uncritical, could
not, in my opinion, help being in the air. There are
different views regarding the part played by Paracelsus.
The instructions that he gives for the production
of the homunculus are found in a work (De
natura rerum) whose authorship is not settled.
And supposing that Paracelsus was the writer, it
must be considered whether he does not lay before
the inquisitive friend to whom the work is dedicated
merely a medley of oddities from the variegated
store that he had collected from all sources on his
travels among vagrant folk. We must accept the
facts as we find them; the question as to whether it
was Paracelsus or not would be idle. Enough that
there is a book by some writer who describes the
<pb n="139"/><anchor id="Pg139"/>
work and describes it in such a way that naïve scholarship
could have thought it quite consistent. The
idea as such has appeared conceivable to us. Its
form in the book mentioned appears clearly determined
by alchemistic ideas. The reader will immediately
perceive it himself as I give here some passages
from the book. (Cf. the Strassb. Folio Ausg.
des Paracelsus, Vol. I, pp. 881-884.) A consideration
of the production of the homunculus appears
important to me because it shows the main content
of alchemistic ideas in enlarged form and complete
development, a content that gives, moreover, the very
thing that psychoanalysis would here look for.
</p>

<p>
Paracelsus begins with the fact that putrefaction
transforms all things into their first shape and is the
beginning of generation and multiplication. The
spagiric [One of the names for alchemy. From
σπᾶν (separate), and αγείρειν (unite).] art is able to
create men and monsters. Such a monster is the
Basilisk. <q>The Basilisk</q> grows and is born out of
and from the greatest impurity of women, namely
from the menstrua and from the blood of sperm that
is put into a glass and cucurbit, and putrefied in a
horse's belly. In such putrefaction is the Basilisk
born. Whoever is so daring and so fortunate as
to make it or to take it out or again to kill it, who
does not clothe and protect himself before with mirrors?
I advise no one but I wish to give sufficient
warning. [Many fables about the Basilisk were
then current. The belief, too, was general that this
terrible animal was produced from a hen's egg.
<pb n="140"/><anchor id="Pg140"/>
Herein lies, again, the idea of unnatural procreation.] ...
Now the generation of the homunculus
is not to be forgotten. For there is something in it,
notwithstanding that it has till now been kept in
mystery and concealed, and that not a little doubt
and question there was among some of the old philosophers,
whether it was possible for art and nature
that a man should be born outside a woman's body
and a natural mother. To which I give the answer
that it is in no way contrary to the spagiric art and
nature, but is quite possible; but how such accomplishment
and occurrence may be, is by the following
procedure: Namely that the semen of a man is
putrefied in a closed cucurbit per se, with the greatest
putrefaction in a horse's belly for 40 days or until
it comes to life and moves and stirs, which is easily
to be seen. [Horse's belly by metonomy for horse's
dung. Horse manure or dung was an easily procured
material that served the purpose of keeping
warm at an even mild and moist heat a vessel that
was put into it. Horse manure is then finally the
gentle <q>moist heat</q> in general engendered by any
means. In the preceding case surely the narrower
meaning of animal belly or dung should not be overlooked.
Here indeed this belly with its moist
warmth has to act as an equivalent for a uterus.]
After such a time it will look something like a man
but transparent without a body. So after this it is
daily fed whitish (weisslich) with the Arcano sanguinis
humani [the water of life that nourishes the
fœtus] and nourished about 40 weeks and kept in the
<pb n="141"/><anchor id="Pg141"/>
even warmth of a horse's belly. A real live human
child will come forth with all members like another
child that is born of a woman but much smaller.
We call it homunculus and it should then be brought
up just like another child with great diligence and
care till it comes to its days of understanding. That
is now the highest and greatest mystery that God has
let mortal and sinful man know. For it is a miracle
and magnale Dei, and a mystery above all mystery
and should also be kept a mystery fairly till the judgment
day, as then nothing will stay hidden, but all
will be revealed.
</p>

<p>
<q>And although such a thing has hitherto been hidden
from natural man, it has not been hidden from
the fauns and the nymphs and giants, but has been
revealed for a long time; whence they too, come.
For from such homunculi, when they come to the
age of manhood come giants, dwarfs and other similar
great wonder people, [Just like Genesis vi, 4]
that were used for a great tool and instrument, who
had a great mighty victory over their enemies and
knew all secret and hidden things that are for all men
impossible to know. For by art they received their
life, through art they received body, flesh, bone and
blood, through art were they born. Therefore the
art was embodied and born in them and they had to
learn it from no one, but one must learn from them.
For because of art are they there and grown up like
a rose or flower in the garden and are called the
children of fauns and nymphs because that they with
their powers and deeds, not to men but to spirits
<pb n="142"/><anchor id="Pg142"/>
are compared.</q> [It is characteristic that Paracelsus
passes immediately to the production of metals.]
</p>

<p>
In the description of the generation of the homunculus
the power of rotting material has been pointed
out. There is clearly evident a feeding with a
magisterium from blood (water of life) corresponding
to the intrauterine alimentation. We note that
from the homunculi come giants and dwarfs and
wonderful beings.
</p>

<p>
The idea of palingenesis appears to have no little
significance for the existence of the homunculus production.
They imagine that a dead living being
could be restored, at least in a smokelike image, if
they carefully collected all its parts, triturated them
and treated the composition in a vessel with the
proper fire. Then there would appear after a time,
like a cloud of smoke, the faint image of the former
being, plant, bird, man. The clouds vanish if the
heating is interrupted. Further it would be possible,
even if more difficult, to pass beyond this mere
adumbration, and cause the former being to arise
again from the ashes, fully alive. In the recipes for
this an important rôle is regularly played by horse
manure or some other rotting substance. Many authors
tell fables of all sorts of wonderful experiments
that they have made. One tells that he has
reduced a bird to ashes and made it live again, another
will have seen in his retort and coming from
the moldering corpse of a child its shadow image,
etc. We see here in actuality the mythical motive
of dismemberment and revivification expressed in a
<pb n="143"/><anchor id="Pg143"/>
naïve practice. It is quite noticeable that this practice
follows the same lines as the mythical representation.
<emph>All</emph> the constituent parts of the body that is
<emph>cut into little pieces</emph> must be carefully collected and
put in a <emph>vessel</emph> and (generally) <emph>cooked</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The human child as result of cooking or else of a
similar process in a vessel, is not infrequent in primitive
myths. I could mention a Zulu myth (Frobenius,
Zeitalt. d. Sonneng., I, p. 237) of a formerly
barren woman. It was said that she should catch a
drop of blood in a pot, cover it up and set it by for
eight months, and should open it in the ninth month.
The woman did as she was advised and found a
child in the pot. The drop of blood, be it noted,
came from herself. The numerous whale dragon
myths (Frobenius) where it is very hot inside of
the whale, belong here in motive. From the whale's
belly comes indeed the baked young (sun) hero.
[Who moreover generally gets nourishment in the
whale-dragon's belly. Nutritio. Heart motive according
to Frobenius.] It is interesting that the
idea of cooking human beings occurs very clearly in
a well analyzed case of dementia precox. (Spielrein
in Jb. ps. F., Ill, pp. 358 ff.) In the strongly regressive
phantasies of the invalid, fragments of all
sorts of things are cooked or roasted and the ashes
can become men.
</p>

<p>
A very interesting variant of the infantile theories
of procreation of the living in dung is found in the
book, <q>De Homunculis et Monstris</q> (Vol. II, pp.
278 ff. of the Strassburg edition of the works of
<pb n="144"/><anchor id="Pg144"/>
Paracelsus). It is there maintained that by sodomy
as well as by pederasty (specifically coitus in anum
and also in os is meant) the generation of a monster
is possible.
</p>

<p>
As they did with alchemy in general, so charlatans
also made use of the production of the homunculus.
Their business was based on the great profits that
were offered by the possession of a homunculus and
that are equivalent to those of mandrake alum.
Mandrake alum gave a certain impetus to the development
of the homunculus idea and practice. It can
be shown that secrets of procreation seem partly to
underlie this also.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to show the possibility that many a
duffer was led toward the production of the homunculus
by erroneous interpretation of the procreation
symbolism occurring in the alchemistic writings. It
was merely necessary, in their limitations, to take
literally one or another of the methods. In this way
there actually occurred the most ludicrous blunders.
Because the philosopher's egg was mentioned, they
took eggs as the actual subject. Because the spermatic
substance and seeds were mentioned they thought
that the prima materia was human semen, and so
arose the school of seminalists. And because it was
written of the subject that it was to be found wherever
men dwell, and that it was a little despised
thing which men threw away not realizing its worth,
and because they thought of putrefaction as such,
they thought to find the real substance in human
excrement, and so the school of stercoralists was
<pb n="145"/><anchor id="Pg145"/>
founded. From the belief in the healing and wonderworking
power of excrement sprang moreover
the famous filth pharmacy, that was held in no little
esteem.
</p>

<p>
The homunculus topic is exceedingly interesting.
Unfortunately I cannot in the space of this book go
into it thoroughly. I shall do so in another place.

<head>The Hermetic Art.</head>

<p>
Any one that makes a thorough study of the alchemistic
literature must be struck with the religious
seriousness that prevails in the writings of the more
important authors. Every <q>master</q> who enjoyed
the highest honor among his fellows in the hermetic
art has a certain lofty manner that keeps aloof from
the detailed description of chemical laboratory work,
although they do not depart from the alchemistic
technical language. They obviously have a leaning
toward some themes that are far more important
than the production of a chemical preparation can be,
even if this is a tincture with which they can tinge
lead into gold. Looking forth to higher nobler
things, these authors, whose homely language frequently
touches our feelings deeply, make the reader
notice that they have nothing in common with the
sloppy cooks who boil their pots in chemical kitchens,
and that the gold they write about is not the gold
of the multitude; not the venal gold that they can
exchange for money. Their language seems to
sound as if they said, <q>Our gold is not of this
world.</q> Indeed they use expressions that can with
absolute clearness be shown to have this sense. Authors
of this type did not weary of enjoining on the
<pb n="147"/><anchor id="Pg147"/>
novices of the art, that belief, scripture and righteousness
were the most important requisites for the
alchemistic process. [With the sloppers it was indeed
a prime question, how many and what kinds of
stoves, retorts, kettles, crucibles, ores, fires, etc., in
short, what necessary implements they needed, for
the great work.]
</p>

<p>
He whose eyes are open needs no special hints to
see, in reading, that the so-called alchemistic prescriptions
did not center upon a chemical process. A
faint notion of the circumstance that even in their
beginnings, alchemistic theories were blended with
cosmogonic and religious ideas, must make it quite
evident that, for example, in the famous Smaragdine
Tablet of Hermes [Its real author is unknown.] a
noble pillar of alchemy, something more must be
contained than a mere chemical recipe. The language
of the Smaragdine tablet is notoriously the
most obscure that the hermetic literature has produced;
in it there are no clear recommendations to
belief or righteousness; and yet I think that an unprejudiced
reader, who was not looking specially
for a chemical prescription, would perceive at least
a feeling for something of philosophy or theology.

</p>

<p>
Sun and gold are identical in the hieroglyphic
mode of expression. Whoever seeks only the chemical
must therefore read: The work of gold, the production
of gold; and that is what thousands and millions
have read. The mere word gold was enough
to make countless souls blind to everything besides
the gold recipe that might be found in the Smaragdine
tablet. But surely there were alchemistic masters
who did not let themselves be blinded by the
word gold and sympathetically carried out still further
the language of the Smaragdine tablet. They
were the previously mentioned lofty-minded men.
The covetous crowd of sloppers, however, adhered
to the gold of the Smaragdine tablet and other writings
and had no appreciation of anything else. For
a long time alchemy meant no more for modern historians.
</p>

<pb n="150"/><anchor id="Pg150"/>

<p>
The fact that modern chemical science is sprung
from the hermetic works,&mdash;as the only branch at
present clearly visible and comprehensible of this
misty tree of knowledge,&mdash;has had for result that
in looking back we have received a false impression.
Chemical specialists have made researches in the
hermetic art and have been caught just as completely
in the tangle of its hieroglyphics as were the blind
seekers of gold before them. The hermetic art, or
alchemy in the wider sense, is not exclusively limited
to gold making or even to primitive chemistry. It
should, however, not be surprising to us who are
acquainted with the philosophical presuppositions of
alchemy, that in addition to the chemical and mechanical
side of alchemy a philosophical and religious
side also received consideration and care. I think,
however, that such historical knowledge was not at
all necessary to enable us to gather their pious views
from the religious language of many masters of the
hermetic art. However, this naïve childish logic
was a closed book to the chemists who made historical
researches. They were hindered by their special
knowledge. It is far from my purpose to desire in
the least to minimize the services that a Chevreul
or a Kopp has performed for the history of chemistry;
what I should like to draw attention to is merely
that the honored fathers of the history of chemistry
saw only the lower&mdash;<q>inferius</q>&mdash;and not the
higher&mdash;<q>superius</q>&mdash;phase of alchemy, for example,
in the Smaragdine tablet; and that they used it
as the type of universal judgment in such a way that
<pb n="151"/><anchor id="Pg151"/>
it needed a special faculty for discovery to reopen
a fountain that had been choked up.
</p>

<p>
I now realize that the poets have been more fortunate
than the scientists. Thus Wieland, who, for
example, makes Theophron say in the Musarion
(Book II):
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l rend='margin-left: 10'>The beautiful alone</l>
<l>Can be the object of our love.</l>
<l>The greatest art is only to separate it from its tissue ...</l>
<l>For it [the soul] nothing mortal suffices,</l>
<l>Yea, the pleasure of the gods cannot diminish a thirst</l>
<l>That only the fountain quenches. So my friends</l>
<l>That which other mortals lures like a fly on the hook</l>
<l>To sweet destruction</l>
<l>Because of a lack of higher discriminative art</l>
<l>Becomes for the truly wise</l>
<l>A Pegasus to supramundane travel.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
But the poets usually speak only in figures. I will
therefore rest satisfied with this one example.
</p>

<p>
The service of having rediscovered the intrinsic
value of alchemy over and above its chemical and
physical phase, is to be ascribed probably to the
American, Ethan Allen Hitchcock, who published his
views on the alchemists in the book, <q>Remarks upon
Alchemy and the Alchemists,</q> that appeared in Boston
in 1857, and to the Frenchman, N. Landur, a
writer on the scientific periodical <q>L'Institut,</q> who
wrote in 1868 in similar vein [in the organ <q>L'Institut,</q>
1st Section, Vol. XXXVI, pp. 273 ff.],
though I do not know whether he wrote with knowledge
of the American work. Landur's observations
<pb n="152"/><anchor id="Pg152"/>
are reported by Kopp (Alch., II, p. 192), but he
does not rightly value their worth. It need not be
a reproach to him. He undertook as a chemical
specialist a work that would have required quite as
much a psychologist, a philosopher or a theologian.
</p>

<p>
The discoveries made by the acute Hitchcock are
so important for our analysis, that a complete exposition
of them cannot be dispensed with. I should
like better to refer to Hitchcock's book if it were not
practically inaccessible.
</p>

<p>
We have heard that the greatest stumbling block
for the uninitiated into the hermetic art lay in the
determination of the true subject, the prima materia.
The authors mentioned it by a hundred names; and
the gold seeking toilers were therefore misled in a
hundred ways. Hitchcock with a single word furnishes
us the key to the understanding of the hermetic
masters, when he says: The subject is man. We can
also avail ourselves of a play on words and say the
subject or substance is the subject.
</p>

<p>
The uninitiated read with amazement in many alchemists
that <q>our subjectum,</q> that is, the material
to be worked upon, is also identical with the
vessel, the still, the philosopher's egg, etc. That
becomes intelligible now. Hitchcock writes (H. A.,
p. 117) very pertinently: <q>The work of the alchemists
was one of contemplation and not a work of
the hands. Their alembic, furnace, cucurbit, retort,
philosophical egg, etc., etc., in which the work of
fermentation, distillation, extraction of essences and
<pb n="153"/><anchor id="Pg153"/>
spirits and the preparation of salts is said to have
taken place was Man,&mdash;yourself, friendly reader,&mdash;and
if you will take yourself into your own study
and be candid and honest, acknowledging no other
guide or authority but Truth, you may easily discover
something of hermetic philosophy; and if at
the beginning there should be <q>fear and trembling</q>
the end may be a more than compensating peace.</q>
</p>

<p>
The alchemist Alipili (H. A., p. 34) writes:
<q>The highest wisdom consists in this, for man to
know himself, because in him God has placed his
eternal Word.... Therefore let the high inquirers
and searchers into the deep mysteries of nature learn
first to know what they have in themselves, and by
the divine power within them let them first heal themselves
and transmute their own souls, ... if that
which thou seekest thou findest not within thee, thou
wilt never find it without thee. If thou knowest not
the excellency of thine house, why dost thou seek and
search after the excellency of other things? The
universal Orb of the world contains not so great mysteries
and excellences as does a little man formed
by God in his own image. And he who desires the
primacy amongst the students of nature, will nowhere
find a greater or better field of study than
himself. Therefore will I here follow the example
of the Egyptians and ... from certain true experience
proclaim, O Man, know thyself; in thee is hid
the treasure of treasures.</q>
</p>

<p>
A seminalist has concluded from this that the
<pb n="154"/><anchor id="Pg154"/>
prima materia is semen, a stercoralist, that it is dung.
</p>

<p>
George Ripley describes the subject of the philosopher's
stone as follows:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>For as of one mass was made the thing,</q></l>
<l>Right must it so in our praxis be,</l>
<l>All our secrets of one image must spring;</l>
<l>In philosophers' books therefore who wishes may see,</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Our stone is called the less-world, one and three.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
The stone is therefore the world in little, the
microcosm, man; one, a unity, three, [Symbol: Mercury] mercury,
[Symbol: Sulphur] sulphur, [Symbol: Salt] salt, or spirit, soul, body. Dichotomy
also appears, mercury and sulphur, which can
then generally be rendered soul and body. One author
says, <q>We must choose such minerals as consist
of a living mercury and a living sulphur; work
it gently, not with haste and hurry.</q> [Cf. Tabula
Smaragdina 9, <q>suaviter</q> ...]
</p>

<p>
Hitchcock (H. A., p. 42): <q>The <q>one</q> thing
of the alchemists is above all man, according to his
nature [as a nature] essentially and substantially
one. But if the authors refer to man phenomenally
they speak of him under different names, indicating
different states as he is before or after <q>purification</q>
or they refer to his body, his soul or his spirit under
different names. Sometimes they speak of the whole
man as mercury, ... and then by the same word
perhaps they speak of something special, as our mercury
which has besides, a multitude of other names ...
although men are of diverse dispositions and
temperaments, some being angelic and others satanic,
<pb n="155"/><anchor id="Pg155"/>
yet the alchemists maintain with St. Paul that <q>all
the nations of men are of one blood,</q> that is, of one
nature. And it is that in man by which he is of one
nature which it is the special object of alchemy to
bring into life and activity; that by whose means, if
it could universally prevail, mankind would be constituted
into a brotherhood.</q>
</p>

<p>
The alchemist says that a great difficulty at the
outset of the work is the finding or making of their
necessarily indispensable mercury, which they also
call green lion, mercurius animatus, the serpent, the
dragon, acid water, vinegar, etc.
</p>

<p>
What is this mysterious mercury, susceptible to
evolution, lying in mankind, common to all, but differently
worked out? Hitchcock answers, conscience.
Conscience is not equally <q>pure</q> with all
men, and not equally developed; the difficulty of
discovering it, of which the alchemists tell, is the
difficulty of arousing it in the heart of man for the
heart's improvement and elevation. The starting
point in the education of man is indeed to awaken
in his heart an enduring, permanent sense of the
absolutely right, and the consistent purpose of adhering
to this sense. It is above all one of the hardest
things in the world <q>to take a man in what is called
his natural state, St. Paul's natural man, after he has
been for years in the indulgence of all his passions,
having a view to the world, to honors, pleasures,
wealth, and make him sensible of the mere abstract
claims of right, and willing to relinquish one single
passion in deference to it.</q> Surely that is the one
<pb n="156"/><anchor id="Pg156"/>
great task of the educator; if it be accomplished, the
work of improvement is easy and can properly be
called mere child's play, as the hermetics like to call
the later phases of their work. (H. A., pp. 45 ff.)
</p>

<p>
No one is so suspicious and so sensitive as those
whose conscience is not sensitive enough. Such people
who wander in error themselves, are like porcupines:
it is very difficult to approach them. The alchemists
have suitable names for them as arsenic,
vipers, etc., and yet they seek in all these substances,
and in antimony, lead, and many other materials,
for a true mercury that has just as many names as
there are substances in which it is found; oil, vinegar,
honey, wormwood, etc. Under all its names
mercury is still, however, a single immutable thing.
It was also called an incombustible sulphur for
whoever has his conscience once rightly awakened,
has in his heart an endlessly burning flame that eats
up everything that is contrary to his nature. This
fire that can burn like <q>poison</q> is a powerful medicine,
the only right one for a (morally) sick soul.
</p>

<p>
Conscience in the crude state is generally called by
the alchemists <q>common quicksilver</q> in contrast to
<q>our quicksilver.</q> To replace the first by the second
and, according to the demands of nature, not
forcibly, is the one great aim that the hermetics follow.
This first goal is a preparation for a further
work. Whither this leads we can represent in one
word&mdash;<q>God</q>&mdash;and even here we may be struck
with the <q>circular</q> character of the whole hermetic
work, since the heavenly mercury that is necessary
<pb n="157"/><anchor id="Pg157"/>
to the preliminary work, to the purification, is yet
itself a gift of God; the beginning depends on the
end and presupposes it. The symbol of the prima
materia is not without purpose a snake that has its
tail in its mouth. I cannot, in anticipation, enter
into the problem that arises in this connection; only
let it be understood in a word that the end can soar
beyond the beginning as an ideal.
</p>

<p>
What is to be done with the messenger of heaven,
mercury, or conscience, when it has been discovered?
Several alchemists give the instruction to sow the
gold in mercury as in the earth, <q>philosophic gold</q>
that is also called Venus-love. Often the New Testament
proves the best commentary on the hermetic
writings. In Corinthians III, 9, ff., we read:
<q>Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.
According to the grace of God which is given unto
me as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation
and another buildeth thereupon. For other
foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this
foundation gold, silver, precious stones, hay, stubble....
Every man's work shall be made manifest ...
because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire
shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</q> And
Galatians VI, 7 ff.: <q>For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his
flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that
soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
And let him not be weary in well doing; for
in due season we shall reap if we faint not.</q> The
<pb n="158"/><anchor id="Pg158"/>
spirit to which it is sowed there is [Symbol: Mercury], mercury, and
the gold that will come out is to be proved in the
fire.
</p>

<p>
The alchemists speak of men very often as of
metals. Before I cite from the work of Johann
Isaak Hollandus on lead, I call to mind that lead, [Symbol: Saturn],
bears the name of Saturn. The writing of Hollandus
could quite as well be called a treatise on mankind
as on lead. To understand this better, be it
added that man in a state of humility or resignation
must specially be associated with lead, the soft, dark
metal.
</p>

<p>
The publisher of the English translation of J. I.
Hollandus, which is dated 1670, addresses the
reader as follows: <q>Kind reader, the philosophers
have written much about their lead, which as Basilus
has taught, is prepared from antimony; and I am
under the impression that this saturnine work of the
present philosopher, Mr. Johann Isaak Hollandus,
is not to be understood of common lead ... but of
the lead of the philosophers.</q>
</p>

<p>
And in Hollandus himself we read: <q>In the
name of God, Amen.&mdash;My child, know that the
stone called the Philosopher's Stone comes from
Saturn. And know my child as a truth that in the
whole vegetable work [vegetable on account of the
symbolism of the sowing and growing] there is no
higher or greater secret than in Saturn. [Cf. the
previously cited passage from Alipili.] For we find,
ourselves, in [common] gold not the perfection that
is to be found in Saturn, for inwardly he is good
<pb n="159"/><anchor id="Pg159"/>
gold. In this all philosophers agree; and it is necessary
only that you reject everything that is superfluous,
then that you turn the within outward,
which is the red; then it will be good gold. [H. A.,
p. 74, notes that Hollandus himself means the same
as Isaiah L, 16. <q>Wash you, make you clean; put
away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes,</q>
etc.] Gold cannot be made so easily of anything
as of Saturn, for Saturn is easily dissolved and congealed,
and its mercury may be more easily extracted
from it.</q> [That means therefore that the conscience
easily develops after the destruction of superfluities
or obstacles in the plastic lead man.] <q>And
this mercury extracted from Saturn is purified and
sublimated, as mercury is usually sublimed. I tell
thee, my child, that the same mercury is as good as
the mercury extracted from gold in all operations.</q>
[Herein lies, according to H. A., an allusion to the
fact that all men are essentially of one nature, inasmuch
as the image of God dwells in them all.]
</p>

<p>
<q>All these strange parables, in which the philosophers
have spoken of a stone, a moon, a stove, a
vessel, all of that is Saturn [i.e., all of that is spoken
of mankind] for you may add nothing foreign, outside
of what springs from himself. There is none
so poor in this world that he cannot operate and
promote this work. For Luna may be easily made
of Saturn in a short time [here Luna, silver, stands
for the affections purified]; and in a little time longer
Sol may be made from it. By Sol here I understand
the intellect, which becomes clarified in proportion
<pb n="160"/><anchor id="Pg160"/>
as the affections become purified.... In
Saturn is a perfect mercury; in it are all the colors
of the world, [that is, the whole universe in some
sense lies in the nature of man, whence have proceeded
all religions, all philosophies, all histories, all
fables, all poesy, all arts and sciences.]</q> (P. 77.)
</p>

<p>
Artephius [Hapso]: <q>Without the antimonial
vinegar [conscience] no metal [man] can be whitened
[inwardly pure].... This water is the only
apt and natural medium, clear as fine silver, by which
we ought to receive the tinctures of Sol and Luna
[briefly, if also inexactly, to be paraphrased by soul
and body], so that they may be congealed and
changed into a white and living earth.</q> This water
desires the complete bodies in order that after their
dissolution it may be congealed, fixed and coagulated
into a white earth. [The first step is purification,
releasing, that is, otherwise also conceived as calcination,
etc.; it takes place through conscience, under
whose influence the hard man is made tender and
brought to fluidity.]
</p>

<p>
<q>But their [sc. the alchemists] solution is also
their coagulation; both consist in one operation, for
the one is dissolved and the other congealed. Nor
is there any other water which can dissolve the bodies
but that which abideth with them. Gold and silver
[Sol and Luna as before] are to be exalted in our
water, ... which water is called the middle of the
soul and without which nothing can be done in our
art. It is a vegetable, mineral, and animal fire,
<pb n="161"/><anchor id="Pg161"/>
which conserves the fixed spirits of Sol and Luna,
but destroys and conquers their bodies; for it annihilates,
overturns and changes bodies and metallic
forms, making them to be no bodies, but a fixed
spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The argentum vivum [living silver] is ... the
substance of Sol and Luna, or silver and gold,
changed from baseness to nobility.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It is a living water that comes to moisten the
earth that it may spring forth and in due season
bring forth much fruit.... This aqua vitæ or
water of life, whitens the body and changes it into
a white color....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>How precious and how great a thing is this
water. For without it the work could never be
done or perfected; it is also called vas naturae, the
belly, the womb, receptacle of the tincture, the earth,
the nurse. It is the royal fountain, in which the
king and queen [[Symbol: Sun] and [Symbol: Moon]] bathe themselves; and
the mother, which must be put into and sealed up
within the belly of her infant, and that is Sol himself,
who proceeded from her, and whom she brought
forth; and therefore they have loved one another as
mother and son, and are conjoined together because
they sprang from one root and are of the same substance
and nature. And because this water is the
water of the vegetable life, it causes the dead body to
vegetate, increase and spring forth, and to rise from
death to life, by being dissolved first and then sublimed.
And in doing this the body is converted into
<pb n="162"/><anchor id="Pg162"/>
a spirit and the spirit afterwards into a body....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Our stone consists of a body, a soul, and a
spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It appears then that this composition is not a
work of the hands but a change of natures, because
nature dissolves and joins itself, sublimes and lifts
itself up, and grows white being separated from the
feces [these feces are naturally the same that Hollandus
notes as the <q>superfluities</q>].... Our
brass or latten then is made to ascend by the degrees
of fire, but of its own accord freely and without violence.
But when it ascends on high it is born in
the air or spirit and is changed into a spirit, and becomes
a life with life. And by such an operation
the body becomes of a subtile nature and the spirit
is incorporated with the body, and made one with
it, and by such a sublimation, conjunction and raising
up, the whole, body and spirit, is made white.</q>
(H. A., p. 87.)
</p>

<p>
For elucidation some passages from the Bible
may be useful. Colossians II, 11: <q>In whom also
ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the
flesh by the circumcision of Christ.</q> Psalm LI, 7:
<q>Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.</q> I
Corinthians VI, 11: <q>But ye are washed, but ye
are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the
Lord Jesus.</q> Romans VIII, 13: <q>For if ye live
after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the
Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
live.</q> John IV, 14: <q>But whosoever drinketh of
<pb n="163"/><anchor id="Pg163"/>
the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst;
but the water that I shall give him shall be in him
a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</q>
[In IV, 10, living water is mentioned.] John XII,
24 ff.: <q>... Except a corn of wheat fall into the
ground and die [Putrefactio] it abideth alone; but
if it die it bringeth forth much fruit. He that
loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life
in the world shall keep it unto life eternal.</q>
</p>

<p>
Romans VI, 5 ff.: <q>For if we have been planted
together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also
in the likeness of his resurrection. Knowing this,
that our old man is crucified with him [I must mention
here that the hieroglyph for vinegar is [Symbol: Vinegar]] that
the body of sin might be destroyed....</q>
</p>

<p>
I Corinthians XV, 42 ff.: <q>It is sown in corruption,
it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor,
it is raised in glory.... It is sown a natural
body, it is raised a spiritual body.... The first
Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was
made a quickening spirit.... We shall all be
changed.... For this corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality.</q>
</p>

<p>
I Corinthians XV, 40 ff.: <q>There are celestial
bodies and bodies terrestrial.... There is one
glory of the sun and another glory of the moon.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians II, 14 ff.: <q>For he is our peace, who
hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle
wall of partition between us, having abolished in
his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments
<pb n="164"/><anchor id="Pg164"/>
contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of
twain one new man, so making peace, and that he
might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
cross, having slain the enmity thereby.</q>
</p>

<p>
If we note the two contraries that are to be united
according to the procedure of the hermetic philosophers
with [Symbol: Sun] and [Symbol: Moon] [sun and moon, gold and silver,
etc.] and represent them united with the cross
[Symbol: +] we get [Symbol: Mercury with a sun]; i.e.,
[Symbol: Mercury], the symbol of mercury. This
ideogram conceals the concept, Easter. All these
ideas, as we know, did not originate with Christianity.
</p>

<p>
II Corinthians V, 1: <q>For we know that if our
earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
have a building of God, an house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens.</q>
</p>

<p>
John VII, 38: <q>He that believeth on me ...
out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</q>
</p>

<p>
I mention right here that the hermetic philosophers
do not pursue speculative theology, but that,
as is clearly evident from their writings, they made
the content of the religious doctrine a part of their
life. That was their work, a work of mysticism.
Everything that the reader is inclined to conceive in
the passages above, as probably belonging merely
to the other life, they as Mystics, sought to represent
to themselves on earth, though without prejudice
to the hope of a life beyond. I presume that
they therefore speak of two stones, a celestial and a
terrestrial. The celestial stone is the eternal blessedness
and, as far as the Christian world of ideas is
<pb n="165"/><anchor id="Pg165"/>
considered, is Christ, who has aided mankind to attain
it. The terrestrial stone is the mystical Christ
whom each may cause to be crucified and resurrected
in himself, whereby he attains a kingdom of heaven
on earth with those peculiar qualities that have been
allegorically attributed to the philosopher's stone.
Therefore the terrestrial stone is called a reflection
of the celestial and so it is said that from lead, etc.,
the stone may be easily produced and <q>in a short
time,</q> i.e., not only after death.
</p>

<p>
At any rate in primitive symbolism there seems to
be a religious idea at the bottom of the recommendation
to use the sputum lunæ (moon spittle) or sperm
astrale (star semen), star mucus, in short of an
efflux from the world of light above us, as first material
for the work of our illumination. [In many
alchemistic recipes such things are recommended.
Misunderstanding led to a so-called shooting star
substance being eagerly hunted for. What was
found and thought to be star mucus was a gelatinous
plant.] So it is in this passage from John IX, 5, ff.:
<q>As long as I am in the world I am the light of the
world. When he [Jesus] had thus spoken, he spat
on the ground and made clay of the spittle and
anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, and
said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam [which
is by interpretation: Sent]. He went his way, therefore,
washed, and came seeing.</q> The transference
of a virtue by the receiving of a secretion is a quite
common primitive idea.
</p>

<p>
As Michael Maier (Symbola Aureae Mensae Lib.
<pb n="166"/><anchor id="Pg166"/>
XI) informs us, Melchior Cibinensis, a Hungarian
priest, expressed the secrets of the forbidden art in
the holy form of the Mass. For as birth, life, exaltation,
suffering in fire and then death were, as it
were, ascribed to the Philosopher's Stone in black
and gloomy colors, and finally resurrection and life
in red and other beautiful colors, so he compared his
preparation with the work of the salvation of man
(and the <q>terrestrial</q> stone with the <q>celestial</q>
stone), namely, with the birth, life, suffering, death
and resurrection of Christ. (Höhler, Herm. Phil.,
p. 156.) The making of the Philosopher's Stone is,
so to speak, the Imitation of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Hitchcock (H. A., p. 143) believes that Irenaeus
Philaletha has clearly alluded in a passage of his
writings to the two mental processes, analysis and
synthesis, which lead to the same end. <q>To seek
the unity through Sol, I take it, is to employ the intellect
upon the Idea of Unity, by analysis that terminates
in the parts; whereas to study upon Mercury,
here used for nature at large, is to work synthetically,
and by combining the parts, reach an idea of the
unity. The two lead to the same thing, beginning
as it were from opposite extremes; for the analysis
of any one thing, completely made, must terminate
in the parts, while the parts, upon a synthetical construction,
must reproduce the unity. One of the two
ways indicated by Irenaeus is spoken of as a herculean
labor, which I suppose to be the second, the
reconstruction of a unity by a recombination of the
parts, which in respect to nature is undoubtedly a
<pb n="167"/><anchor id="Pg167"/>
herculean undertaking. The more hopeful method
is by meditation, etc.</q>
</p>

<p>
Some of the writers tell us to put <q>one of the
bodies into the alembic,</q> that is to say, take the soul
into the thought or study and apply the fire (of intellect)
to it, until it <q>goes over</q> into spirit. Then,
<q>putting this by for use,</q> put in <q>the other body,</q>
which is to be subjected to a similar trial until it
<q>goes over</q> also; after which the two may be
united, being found essentially or substantially the
same.
</p>

<p>
The two methods of which Irenaeus speaks are
also called in alchemy (with reference to chemical
procedures) the wet and the dry ways. The wet
way is that which leads to unity through mental elaboration.
The philosophy of the Indian didactic
poetry Bhagavad-Gita also knows the two ways and
calls them Samkhya and Yoga.

<p>
<q>Samkhya</q> and <q>Yoga</q> have later been elaborated
into whole philosophical systems. Originally,
however, they are merely <q>different methods
of arriving at the same end, namely the attainment
of the Atman [all spirit] which on the one hand is
<pb n="168"/><anchor id="Pg168"/>
spread out as the whole infinite universe and on the
other is to be completely and wholly found in the
inner life. In the first sense Atman can be gained by
meditation on the multiplex phenomena of the universe
and their essential unity, and this meditation is
called Samkhya [from sam + khya, reflection, meditation];
on the other hand, Atman is attainable by
retirement from the outer world and concentration
upon one's own inner world and this concentration is
called Yoga.</q> (Deussen, Allg. Gesch. d. Phil., I, 3,
p. 15.)
</p>

<p>
For the practice of alchemy a moral behavior is
required, which is hardly necessary as a precondition
of merely chemical work. The disciple of the art is
to free his character, according to the directions of
the masters from all bad habits, especially to abjure
pride, is diligently to devote himself to prayer, perform
works of love, etc.; no one is to direct his senses
to this study if he has not previously purified his
heart, renounced the love of worldly things, and surrendered
himself completely to God. (Höhler,
Herm. Phil., pp. 62 ff.)
</p>

<p>
The sloppers, who strive to make gold in a chemical
laboratory often waste in it their entire estate.
The adepts, however, assure us that even a poor man
can obtain the stone; many, indeed, say the poor
have a better materia than the rich. Rom. II, 11:
<q>For there is no respect of persons with God.</q>
Matth. XIX, 24: <q>It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter into the kingdom of God.</q> The alchemist
<pb n="169"/><anchor id="Pg169"/>
Khunrath says somewhere, the cost of making gold
amounts to thirty dollars; we understand this when
we remember that Jesus was sold for thirty pence.
</p>

<p>
Ruland (Lex., p. 26) defines alchemy very finely:
[In reference to Tab. Smar., 9] <q>Alchemy is the
separation of the impure from a purer substance.</q>
This is quite as true of the chemical as of the spiritual
alchemy.
</p>

<p>
Why the hermetic philosophers write not literally
but in figures may be accounted for in several ways.
We should first of all remember that because of
their free doctrine, which was indeed not at variance
with true Christianity but with the narrow-minded
church, they had to fear the persecution of the latter,
and that for this reason they veiled their teachings.
Hitchcock notices also a further point. The alchemists
often declare that the knowledge of their secret
is dangerous (for the generality of people). It appears
that they did not deem that the time was ripe
for a religion that was based more on ideal requirements,
on moral freedom, than on fear of hell fire,
expectation of rewards and on externally visible
marks and pledges. Besides we shall see later that
a really clear language is in the nature of things
neither possible nor from an educational point of
view to be recommended.
</p>

<p>
Still the mystical purpose of the authors of those
times when the precautionary measures were not necessary
appears clearer under the alchemistic clothing,
although no general rule applying to it can be
set forth. Other reasons, e.g., intellectual and conventional
<pb n="170"/><anchor id="Pg170"/>
ones, influenced them to retain the symbolism.
</p>

<p>
Very clearly mystical are the writings of a number
of hermetic artists, who are permeated by the
spiritual doctrine of Jacob Boehme. This theosophist
makes such full use of the alchemistic symbolism,
that we find it wherever we open his writings.
I will not even begin to quote him, but will only call
the reader's attention to his brief and beautifully
thoughtful description of the mystical process of
moral perfection, which stands as <q>Processus</q> at
the end of the 5th chapter of his book, <q>De Signatura
Rerum.</q> (Ausg., Gichtel Col., 2218 f.)
</p>

<p>
An anonymous author who has absorbed much of
the <q>Philosophicus Teutonicus,</q> wrote the book,
<q>Amor Proximi,</q> much valued by the amateurs of
the high art. It does not require great penetration
to recognize this pious manual, clothed throughout
in alchemistic garments, as a mystical work. The
same is true of the formerly famous <q>Wasserstein
der Weisen</q> (1st ed. appeared 1619), and similar
books. Here are some illustrative pages from
<q>Amor Proximi</q>:
</p>

<p>
<q>This [Symbol: water] [[Symbol: water] of life] is now the creature not
foreign or external but most intimate in every one,
although hidden.... See Christ is not outside of
us, but intimately within us, although hidden.</q> (P.
32.)
</p>

<p>
<q>Whoever is to work out a thing practically must
first have a fundamental knowledge of a thing; in
order that man shall macrocosmically and magically
<pb n="171"/><anchor id="Pg171"/>
work out the image of God, all God's kingdom, in
himself; he must have its right knowledge in himself....</q> (P. 29.)
</p>

<p>
<q>Christ is the great Universal; [The Grand Mastery
is also called by the alchemists the <q>universal</q>;
it tinctures all metals to gold and heals all diseases
(universal medicine); there is a somewhat more circumscribed
<q>particular,</q> which tinctures only a special
metal and cures only single diseases.] who says:
<q>Whoever will follow me and be my disciple (i.e., a
particular or member of my body), let him take up
his [Symbol: cross] and follow me.</q> Thus one sees that all who
desire to be members of the great universal must
each partake according to the measure of his suffering
and development as small specific remedies.</q>
(Pp. 168 ff.)
</p>

<p>
<q>Paracelsus, the monarch of Arcana, says that
the stars as well as the light of grace, nowhere work
more willingly than in a fasting, pure, and free heart.
As it is naturally true that the coarse sand and ashes
cannot be illumined by the sun, so the <hi rend='smallcaps'>sun</hi> of righteousness
cannot illumine the old Adam. It is then
that the sand and ashes [the old Adam] are melted
in the [Symbol: fire] [of the [Symbol: cross]] again and again, that a pure
glass [a newborn man] is made of it; so the [Symbol: gold/sol] can
easily shoot its rays into and through it and therefore
illumine it and reveal the wonder of its wisdom.
So man must be recast in [Symbol: cross] [Symbol: fire] [cross-fire], so that
the rays of both lights can penetrate him; otherwise
no one will become a wise man.</q> (P. 96 ff.)
</p>

<p>
Beautiful expositions of alchemy that readily make
<pb n="172"/><anchor id="Pg172"/>
manifest the mystical content are found also in the
English theosophists Pordage and his followers, in
particular Jane Leade (both 17th century). Their
language is clearer and more lucid than Jacob
Boehme's. Many passages appropriate to this topic
might be here cited; but as I shall later take up
Leade more fully, I quote only one passage from
Pordage (Sophia, p. 23):
</p>

<p>
<q>Accordingly and so that I should arrive at a fundamental
and complete cleansing from all tares and
earthiness ... I gave over my will entirely to its
[wisdom's] fiery smelting furnace as to a fire of purification,
till all my vain and chaff-like desires and the
tares of earthly lust had been burnt away as by fire,
and all my iron, tin and dross had been entirely
melted in this furnace, so that I appeared in spirit as
a pure gold, and could see a new heaven and a new
earth created and formed within me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Out of all this, taken in conjunction with the following
chapter, it will be evident and beyond question
that our Parable must also be interpreted as a
mystical introduction.

<head>Rosicrucianism And Freemasonry.</head>

<p>
The previous chapter has shown that there was a
higher alchemy&mdash;it was furthermore regarded as
the true alchemy&mdash;which has the same relation to
practical chemistry that freemasonry has to practical
masonry. A prominent chemist who had entered
into the history of chemistry and that of freemasonry
once wrote to me: <q>Whoever desires to make a
chemical preparation according to a hermetic recipe
seems to me like a person who undertakes to build a
house according to the ritual of Freemasonry.</q>
</p>

<p>
The similarity is not a chance one. Both external
and internal relations between alchemy and freemasonry
are worthy of notice. The connection is
partly through rosicrucianism. Since the Parable,
which shall still be the center of our study, belongs
to rosicrucian literature (and indeed is probably a
later development of it), it is fitting here to examine
who and what the Rosicrucians really were. We
cannot, of course, go into a thorough discussion of
this unusually complex subject. We shall mention
only what is necessary to our purpose. I shall not,
however, be partial, but treat of both the parties
which are diametrically opposed in their views of the
problems of rosicrucian history. It will be shown
<pb n="174"/><anchor id="Pg174"/>
that this disagreement fortunately has but small influence
upon our problem and that therefore we are
relieved of the difficult task of reaching a conclusion
and of bringing historical proof for a decision which
experienced specialists&mdash;of whom I am not one&mdash;have
so signally failed to reach.
</p>

<p>
Rosicrucians are divided into those of three periods,
the old, who are connected by the two chief
writings, <q>Fama</q> and <q>Confessio,</q> that appeared
at the beginning of the 17th century; the middle,
which apparently represents a degeneration of the
original idealistic league, and finally, the gold
crossers and rose crossers, who for a time during
the 18th century developed greater power. The last
Rosicrucians broke into freemasonry for a while (in
the second half of the eighteenth century) in a manner
almost catastrophic for continental masonry,
yet I observe in anticipation that this kind of rosicrucian
expansion is not immediately concerned with
the question as to the original relation of freemasonry
and rosicrucianism. We must know how to
distinguish the excrescence from the real idea. Rosicrucianism
died out at the beginning of the 19th century.
The rosicrucian degrees that still exist in
many systems of freemasonry (as Knight of the Red
Cross, etc.) are historical relics. Those who now
parade as rosicrucians are imposters or imposed on,
or societies that have used rosicrucian names as a
label.
</p>

<p>
Many serious scholars doubt that the old Rosicrucians
ever existed as an organized fraternity. I refer
<pb n="175"/><anchor id="Pg175"/>
to the article Rosenkreuz in the <q>Handbuch der
Freimaurerei</q> (Lenning), where this skeptical view
is dominant. Other authors, on the contrary, believe
in the existence of the old order and think that
the freemasons who appeared in their present form
in 1717 are the rosicrucians persisting, but with
changed name. Joh. Gottl. Buhle, a contemporary
of Nicolai, had already assumed that the rosicrucian
Michael Maier introduced rosicrucianism into England,
and that freemasonry began then especially
with the coöperation of the Englishman Robert
Fludd (1574-1637). Ferdinand Katsch warmly
defended the actual existence of the old rosicrucian
fraternity with arguments, some of which are disputed.
He names with certainty a number of people
as <q>true rosicrucians,</q> among them Julianus de
Campis, Michael Maier, Robert Fludd, Frisius or
Frizius, Comenius (Katch, p. 33). Rosicrucianism
turned into freemasonry for practical reasons. As
the most outstanding imposters represented themselves
as rosicrucians this name was not conserved.
The wrong was prevented, in that the true rosicrucians
withdrew as such and assumed a different dress.
</p>

<p>
Generally we imagine a different origin of freemasonry.
We are accustomed to look for its beginnings
in practical masonry, whose lodges can be
traced back to the fourteenth century. The old unions
of house builders were joined by persons who
were not actual workers but lay members, through
whom spiritual power was added to the lodges. At
the beginning of the eighteenth century the old working
<pb n="176"/><anchor id="Pg176"/>
masonry was transformed into the spiritual symbolical
freemasonry, but with a continuance of its
forms. At that time in London the building lodges
had diminished to four. These were united on June
24 (St. John's Day), 1717, and chose Anton Sayer
for their grand master. That is the origin of Freemasonry
as it exists to-day.
</p>

<p>
This derivation is and will be considered unsatisfactory
by many, however much it may satisfy the
merely documentary claims. The attempt to make
it better required an inventive phantasy and this was
not always fortunate in its attempts. The rosicrucian
theory cannot be dismissed off hand, especially
if we conceive it in a somewhat broader sense. In
agreement with Katsch, Höhler (Herm. Phil., p. 6)
recalls how generally people were occupied in the
16th and 17th centuries in the whole of western Europe
with cabala, theosophy, magic (physics), astrology
and alchemy, and indeed this held true of
higher and lower social strata, scholars and laymen,
ecclesiastic and secular. <q>The entire learned theology
turned on cabala. Medicine was based on
theosophy and alchemy and the latter was supposed
to be derived from theosophy and astrology.</q>
Höhler, in one respect, goes further than Katsch and
conjectures: <q>Freemasonry had its roots in the
chemical societies of the 16th and 17th centuries, in
which all those things were fostered that constituted
the science of that day.</q> This theory is incomparably
more open to discussion than if one attempts to
confine the origin to the insecure base of rosicrucianism.
<pb n="177"/><anchor id="Pg177"/>
We shall learn to appreciate more fully the
significance of the chemical societies.
</p>

<p>
In connection with the question, important for us,
as to the position of the alchemy of the rosicrucians
(whether they lived only in books or as an actual
brotherhood), it is worth while to glance at the
literature.
</p>

<p>
Joachin Frizius, whom some think identical with
Fludd, writes in the <q>Summum Bonum, quod est
verum Magiae, Cabalae, Alchymiae, verae Fratrum
Roseae Crucis verorum subjectum</q> (first published
in Frankfort, 1629):
</p>

<p>
<q>Aben (אבן) means a stone. In this one
cabbalistic stone we have the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost ... for in Hebrew Ab (אב) means Father
and Ben (בן) Son. But where the Father
and Son are present there the Holy Ghost must be
also.... Let us now examine this Stone as the
foundation of the macrocosm.... Therefore the
patriarch Jacob spake, <q>How dreadful is this place.
This is none other but the house of God,</q> and rose
up and took the stone that he had put for his pillow
and poured oil upon the top of it, and said, <q>This
stone that I have set for a pillar shall be God's house,
etc.</q> If therefore a God's house, then God is in
that place or else his earthly substance. Here it
was that the patriarch, as he slept on this stone, conserved
something divine and miraculous, through the
power of that spirit-filled stone which in its corporeality
is similar to the relation of the body to the
soul. But the spiritual stone was Christ; but Christ
<pb n="178"/><anchor id="Pg178"/>
is the eternal wisdom, in which as the scripture says
are many mansions, which are undoubtedly distinguished
on account of the different grades of grace
and blessedness. For blessedness follows wisdom
or knowledge, the higher and more we know the
farther we go towards the Godhead.</q> (Summ.
Bon., pp. 17 ff.)
</p>

<p>
<q>Thereupon it clearly appears who this macrocosmic
Stone Aben ... really is, and that his fiery
spirit is the foundation stone of all and given for
all (sit lapis seu petra catholica atque universalis)
... which was laid in Zion as the true foundation,
on which the prophets and the apostles as well have
built, but which was also to the ignorant and wicked
builders a stumbling block and bone of contention.
This stone therefore is Christ who has become our
Cornerstone....</q> (Summ. Bon., p. 19.) <q>If
we consider now the stone Aben in its significance
for the microcosmos ... we shall soon be sure that
as a stone temple of God it can have no less value
for every outer man in so far as the Holy Ghost also
reserves a dwelling in him forever.</q> (Summ. Bon.,
p. 20.)
</p>

<p>
<q>That is also the reason why the stone Aben appears
in double form (quod ambae petrae), that is,
in the macrocosmic and in the microcosmic....
For the spiritual stone is Christ that fulfills all. So
we also are parts of the spiritual stone and such are
also living stones, taken out of that universal stone
(a petra illa catholica excisi)....</q> (Summ. Bon.,
p. 20.) Here again we have the alchemistic distinction
<pb n="179"/><anchor id="Pg179"/>
between the universal and the particular, and
the like distinction is also expressed by the opposition
of the celestial and the terrestrial stones. The
second chapter of I Peter speaks of the living stone.
I Corinthians X, 4, says likewise: <q>And did all
drink of that spiritual Rock that followed them and
that Rock was Christ.</q> Alchemistically expressed
it is called aurum potabile (drinkable gold).
</p>

<p>
<q>But,</q> now you ask, <q>where then is all the gold
with which those alchemists [Fama] glitter so famously?</q>
So we answer you.... <q>Our gold is
indeed not in any way the gold of the multitude, but
it is the living gold, the gold of God.... It is wisdom,
which the psalmist means, Ps. XII, 6, <q>The
words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in
a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</q> If you
now wish ... to put before yourself the true and
actual animal stone, then seek the cornerstone, which
is the means of all change and transformation, in
yourself.</q> (Summ. Bon., pp. 34 ff.)
</p>

<p>
<q>Finally the brother works towards the consummation
of his labors in the form of a master builder
(<hi rend='italic'>denique sub architecti figura operatur frater ad
huius operis perfectionem</hi>).... Only for the better
carrying out of our building and thereby to attain
the rose-red bloom of our cross concealed in the center
of our foundation ... we must not take the
work superficially, but must dig to the center of the
earth, knock and seek.</q> (Summ. Bon., p. 48;
Trans. Katsch, pp. 413 ff.) Just after that he
speaks of the three dimensions, height, depth, and
<pb n="180"/><anchor id="Pg180"/>
breadth. The masonic symbolism is accompanied
clearly enough in the <q>Summum Bonum</q> by the alchemistic.
Notice the knocking and seeking, and
what is mentioned in the doctrines about the form of
the Lodge. Immediately thereafter is a prolix discussion
of the geometric cube.
</p>

<p>
Frizius and Fludd contribute also a letter supposed
to have been sent by rosicrucians to a German candidate.
It says, <q>Since you are such a stone as you
desire, and such a work ... cleanse yourself with
tears, sublimate yourself with manners and virtues,
decorate and color yourself with the sacramental
grace, make your soul sublime toward the subtile
meditation of heavenly things, and conform yourself
to angelic spirits so that you may vivify your moldering
body, your vile ashes, and whiten them, and incorruptibly
and painlessly gain resurrection through
J[esus] C[hrist] O[ur] L[ord].</q> In another passage:
<q>Be ye transformed, therefore, be ye transmuted
from mortal to living philosophic stones.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the <q>Clavis Philosophiae et Alchymiae Fluddanae</q>
(published in Latin in 1633), are passages
like the following: <q>Indeed every pious and righteous
man is a spiritual alchemist.... We understand
by that a man who understands not only how
to distinguish but with the fire of the divine spirit to
separate [spagiric art] the false from the true, vice
from virtue, dark from light, the uncleanness of vice
from the purity of the spirit emulating God. For
only in this way is unclean lead turned into gold.</q>
(P. 75.) <q>If one now ventures to say that the
<pb n="181"/><anchor id="Pg181"/>
Word of Christ or the Holy Ghost of wisdom dwells
in the microcosmic heaven [i.e., in the soul of man]
we should not decry the blind children of the world
as godless and abandoned. [But certainly the divine
spirit is, as is later averred, the rectangular
stone in us, on which we are to build.] This divine
spark is, however, continuous and eternal; it is our
gold purchasable of Christ.... So it happens in
accordance with the teachings of Christ, or the Word
become flesh, that if the true alchemists keep on seeking
and knocking, they attain to the knowledge of the
living fire.</q> (P. 81.) So again the important
knocking and seeking of masonic symbolism, and this
indeed, for the purpose of learning to know a fire.
</p>

<p>
In reference to the really elevating thoughts of
the <q>Summum Bonum,</q> Katsch, enthusiastic about
these ideas, exclaims: <q>What language, what an
unflinching courage, what a dignified humility.
Even the most reluctant will not be able to avoid the
admission that here quite unexpectedly he has ...
met the original and ideal form of freemasonry.</q>
</p>

<p>
The comparison of masonry and alchemy remains
true even if we work more critically than Katsch,
who is accused of many inaccuracies. I recall for
instance the later researches of the thorough and far-seeing
Dr. Ludwig Keller.
</p>

<p>
For the illumination of the darkness that has
spread over the past of freemasonry, Keller shows
us (B. W. and Z., pp. 1, 2) the rich material of
symbolism that is offered the diligent student, first
of all in the very copious literature, printed matter,
<pb n="182"/><anchor id="Pg182"/>
and especially in the manuscripts, that is known by
the name of Chemistry or Alchemy.
</p>

<p>
In the symbols of the alchemists, the rosicrucians,
the Lodges, etc., <q>we meet a language that has
found acceptance among all occidental peoples in
analogous form, not indeed a letter or word language,
but a language nevertheless, a token or a symbol
language of developed form, which is evident
even in the rock temples of the so-called catacombs,
once called latomies and loggie. The single images
and symbols have something to say only to the person
who understands this language. To the man
who does not understand it, they say nothing and are
not expected to say anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
In reference to the symbol and image language,
which was comprehensible only to the initiated, we
think naturally of the ancient mysteries. The religious
societies of the oldest Christians, in the centuries
when Christianity belonged in the Roman Empire
to the forbidden cults, found a possibility of
existence before the law in the form of licensed societies,
i.e., as guilds, burial unions, and corporations
of all sorts. The primitive Christians were not the
only forbidden sects that sought and found this recourse.
Under the disguise of schools, trade unions,
literary societies, and academies, there existed in the
jurisdiction of the Roman Empire, and later inside
of the world church, organizations that before the
law were secular societies, but in the minds of the
initiated were associations of a religious character.
Within these associations there appeared very early
<pb n="183"/><anchor id="Pg183"/>
a well developed system of symbols, which were
adopted for the purpose of actually maintaining,
through the concealment necessitated by circumstances,
their unions and their implements and customs&mdash;symbols
that they chose as cloaks and that
in the circle of the initiated were explained and interpreted
according to the teachings of their cult.
</p>

<p>
Valuable monuments of this symbolism are preserved
in the vast rock temples that are found in
Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor, Sicily, and the Apennine
peninsula, in Greece, France, and on the Rhine, and
these vaults, which in part also served the early
Christians as places of worship, show in their images
and records and in their architectural form so close
a resemblance that they must be acknowledged as
the characteristic of a great religious cult extending
over many lands, which has had consistent traditions
for the use of such symbols and for the production of
these structures.
</p>

<p>
Many of these symbols, it should be noted in passing,
are borrowed from those tokens and implements
of the building corporations, which were necessary
to the completion of their buildings (Keller, l. c.,
p. 4). An important part was played even in the
early Christian symbolism by the sacred numbers
and the figures corresponding to them, a group of
educational symbols which we find likewise in the
pythagorean and platonic schools. It is known that
the symbolical language of the subterranean rock
temples, some of which were used by the earliest
Christians for their religious worship, are closely
<pb n="184"/><anchor id="Pg184"/>
connected with the pythagorean and platonic doctrines.
From the year 325 <hi rend='smallcaps'>A. D.</hi> on, every departure
from the beliefs of the state church was considered
a state offense. So those Christians who retained
connection with the ancient philosophic schools were
persecuted. In the religious symbol language of the
church, the sacred numbers naturally began to disappear
from that time. In the writings of Augustine
begins the war on the symbolic language, whose
use he declared a characteristic of the gnostics. In
spite of the suppression the doctrines of the sacred
numbers continued through all the centuries in religious
use, in quiet but strong currents which flowed
beside the state church. The sect names, which
were invented by polemic theology for the purpose
of characterizing methods that were regarded
as imitations of the gnostics, are of the most varied
kinds; it may be enough to remember that in all those
spiritual currents, that like the old German mysticism,
the earlier humanism, the so-called natural philosophy,
etc., show a strong influence of platonic
thinking, the doctrines of the sacred numbers recur,
in a more or less disguised form, but yet clearly recognizable.
(Keller, Heil. Zahl., p. 2.)
</p>

<p>
As the old number symbolism constitutes a part
of the hieroglyphics of alchemy, I shall pause a moment
to consider them. The use of mathematical
and geometrical symbols proceeds from the use of
the simplest forms, points and lines, but in all cases
where the object is not a representation in the flat but
in space, both the points and lines are replaced by
<pb n="185"/><anchor id="Pg185"/>
plastic forms, i.e., forms of cylinders, spheres, bars,
rings, cubes, etc. From this point it was but a short
step to the use of trees, leaves, flowers, implements,
and other things that showed similarities in form.
Pillars are specially noticeable for the symbolism of
the ceremonial chamber. In all cases where points
and lines occur in images and drawings, pillars are
found in the plastic representation of thoughts and
symbols. They form the chief element of the organization
of cults in academies and museums, and
justify the names of colonnade, stoa, portico, and
loggia, which occur everywhere; besides the special
designation like Οἰκυς αἰονὶος, etc.
</p>

<p>
For symbolism, too, which served as the characterization
of the forms of organization and the
building up of the fraternity into degrees, lines were
useless, but in place of lines and points are found
plastic forms which were at their disposal in carpenters'
squares, crossed bars, etc. (Keller, l. c.,
p. 10.)
</p>

<p>
As the circle symbolized the all and the eternal or
the celestial unity of the all, and the divinity, so the
number one, the single line, the staff or the scepter,
represented the terrestrial copy of the power, the
ruling, guiding, sustaining and protecting force of
the personality that had attained freedom on earth.
</p>

<p>
The sun or gold symbol [Symbol: Sun] corresponds in alchemy
to the divine circle and the same circle occurs in
other symbols of the art, as in [Symbol: Copper] [Symbol: Mercury], etc.
</p>

<p>
Duality, the Dyas, represents in contrast to the
celestial being the divided terrestrial being that is
<pb n="186"/><anchor id="Pg186"/>
dominated by the antagonism of things and is only
a transitory, imperfect existence; the opposites, fluid
and solid, sulphur and mercury, dry and wet, etc.
</p>

<p>
In the symbol of the trinity, which frequently occurs
in the form of a triangle (three points united
by three straight lines), is shown how the divided
and sensuous nature is led by the higher power of
the number 3 to a harmony of powers and to a new
unity. The symbol of reason attaining victory over
matter becomes visible. A representation of trinity
is possible by means of the conventional cross. We
can see in it two elements of lines which by their unification
or penetration give the third as the point of
intersection. More generally the cross is conceived
as quinity (fiveness)&mdash;i.e., 4+1ness (in alchemy
four elements which are collected about the quinta
esentia). A cross in which unity splits into duality
so that trinity results, is Y, which is called the forked
cross. From unity grows duality, that is, nature
divides into spirit and matter, into active and passive,
necessity and freedom. The divided returns
through trinity to unity. In alchemy we have the
symbol REBIS, the hermaphrodite with the two
heads. The ancient symbol was later conceived, by
purposive concealment or by more accidental interpretation,
as the letter Y, just as the symbol of the
three lines [Symbol: fire] or [Symbol: fire with
a line coming out top pointing left] and the like gradually appears
to have become an A, as it is found frequently in the
catacombs. Keller refers (l. c., p. 14) also especially
to the reduplication of the carpenter's square,
which is found likewise in the old Latomies (Gk. =
<pb n="187"/><anchor id="Pg187"/>
quarries) and has the appearance of two intersecting
opened circles. I do not need to call attention to the
masonic analogue; in alchemy we have here the interpenetration
of [Symbol: fire] and [Symbol: Water], i.e., [Symbol: Star of David], which is among
others the symbol for the material of the stone.
[[Symbol: Fire] and [Symbol: Water] are the symbols for the elements fire
and water. Fire and water, however, mean also the
famous two opposites, that are symbolized quite as
well by warm and cold, red and white, soul and
body, sun and moon, man and woman.] With regard
to the six points, in alchemy [Symbol: Star of David] is also called
chaos in contrast to [Symbol: Star of David], which denotes cosmos, just
as alum [Symbol: circle] on account of its lack of a center (God,
belief, union), is incomplete beside [Symbol: sol]. In the catacombs
the triangle is found also in multiple [five
fold] combination, [Symbol: Star of David].
</p>

<p>
Four lines, somewhat in the form of a rectangle,
define the limited space of the terrestrial world with
the accessory meaning of the holy precinct, house,
temple. In masonry, [Symbol: square] is well known as the lodge.
The rectangle is related to the cube. I mention
therefore in this place the cubic stone, the mighty
masonic symbol, whose equivalent in alchemy will be
discussed.
</p>

<p>
By a commonly used change of significance the
number 5 is symbolized by 5-leaved plants (rose,
lily, vine). <q>The flowers, however, and the garden
in which they grow, early served as symbols of the
Fields of the Blessed or the <q>better country</q> in
which dwell the souls passing through death to life;
in antithesis to the terrestrial house of God, the
<pb n="188"/><anchor id="Pg188"/>
temple built with hands, which was represented by
the rectangle [Symbol: rectangle], the holy number 5 denoted the
celestial abodes of the souls that had attained perfection,
and therefore represented both the House
of Eternity or the City of God and the Heavenly
Jerusalem. The holy pentagram in the form of the
rose, not only in the ancient but in the early Christian
world, decorated the graves of the dead, that
in their turn symbolized the gardens of the blessed.
And the significance that the academies and loggia
attributed to the pentagram placed in the rose is explained
by the fact that their religious festival was
closely connected with this emblem. Already in the
ancient world at the festival of St. John, the rose
feast or rhodismus or Rosalia was celebrated, at
which the participants adorned themselves with roses
and held religious feasts.</q> (Keller, 1. c., p. 21.)
</p>

<p>
As already mentioned, the cross, i.e., the Greek
cross with its four equal arms, expresses the number
five. It is interesting that already in the ancient
number symbolism, rose and cross appear united, a
fact which I mention here in view of the later connection
of these two objects.
</p>

<p>
The semicircle or moon is an emblem of borrowed
light. Besides the circles or spheres, the symbols
of eons (divine beings, powers) that are enthroned
in the ether as eternal beings, the human soul&mdash;the
psyche or anima, which does not coincide with reason
or the purified soul&mdash;appears as a broken circle.
As the sun and its symbol, the ragged circle, symbolize
the eternal light, the half circle is, as it were,
<pb n="189"/><anchor id="Pg189"/>
the symbol of that spark of light that slumbers in
the soul of man, or, as the alchemists often say, the
hidden fire that is to be awakened by the process.
If we reflect that in this symbolism the cross expresses
a penetration, the alchemic symbol [Symbol: mercury] is explained.
It is now quite interesting that the like
connection appears in the subterranean places of worship
in this form [Symbol: female with concave arc underneath it],
(l. c., p. 27). Keller calls it a
symbol of the all and the soul of man.
</p>

<p>
The number 7 (seven planets, etc.) also is of some
importance in the old latomies. It is noteworthy
besides that sun and moon usually appear as human
forms; the sun wears on its head a crown or garland
or beaming star, while the moon image is wont to
carry the symbol [Symbol: Silver]. Alchemy, too, likes to represent
[Symbol: Gold] and [Symbol: Silver] as human, and indeed frequently as
crowned figures, sometimes as a royal bridal couple.
</p>

<p>
The ancient lore of the sacred numbers breathes a
spirit that may be embodied in the following words:
The soul of man, which through resignation or meekness,
as they used to say then, is impelled onward
to purity and union with the Eternal, has in itself
a higher life, which cannot be annihilated by death.
The doctrine of the infinite value of the soul ...
and of God's entering into the pure soul of man
forms the central point of the thought of religious
fellowship. Neither for sacrifice, which the state
religions practice, nor for the beliefs in demons, by
which the masses are controlled, nor for the idea
of priesthood as means of salvation, was there a
place in this system, and not a trace of such a belief
<pb n="190"/><anchor id="Pg190"/>
is demonstrable in this religion of wisdom and virtue.
(l. c., p. 33.)
</p>

<p>
Besides the early Christian ideal, which recognized
and encouraged the connection between the
teachings of Christ and the ancient wisdom of platonism,
there was in early times another which emphasized
and endeavored to develop the antithesis
more than the connection. From the time when the
new Christian state church came to life, and sacrificial
religion and the belief in devils and the priesthood
were restored, a struggle of life and death developed
between the church and the so-called philosophic
schools. <q>The fraternity saw that it had to
draw down the mask still further over its face than
formerly, and the <q>House of the Eternal,</q> the
<q>Basilika,</q> the <q>Academies,</q> and the <q>Museums</q> became
workshops of stone cutters, latomies, and loggia
or innocent guilds, unions, and companies of
every variety. But all later greater religious movements
and tendencies which maintained the old beliefs,
whether they appeared under the names of
mysticism, alchemy, natural philosophy, humanism,
or special names and disguises, as workshops or societies,
have preserved more or less truly the doctrine
of the <q>sacred numbers</q> and the number symbolism,
and found the keys of wisdom and knowledge
in the rightly understood doctrine of the eternal
harmony of the spheres.</q> (Keller, l. c., p. 38.)
</p>

<p>
Keller derives modern freemasonry from the academies
of the renaissance, which, as we have just
heard, continued the spirit of the ancient academies.
<pb n="191"/><anchor id="Pg191"/>
Now it is interesting that the later branches of these
religious societies (after the renaissance) took
among others the form of alchemy companies and
further that such fraternities or companies [as are
not called alchemical], still employed symbols that
we recognize as derived from alchemy. The hieroglyphics
of alchemy appear to be peculiarly appropriate
to the religious and philosophic ideas to be
treated of. Rosicrucianism was, however, one of
the forms into which alchemy was organized. It is
further important that in just those societies of the
beginning of the seventeenth century which outsiders
called <q>alchymists</q> or <q>rosicrucians,</q> the characteristic
emblems of the old lodge appeared, as, for
instance, the circle, the cubic stone, the level, the
man facing the right, the sphere, the oblong rectangle
(symbol of the Lodge), etc. (Keller, Zur Gesch.
d. Bauh., p. 17.) These <q>alchymists</q> honored St.
John in the same way as can be shown for the companies
of the fifteenth century. I need not mention
that modern masonry, in its most important form,
bears the name of Masons of St. John.
</p>

<p>
From the beginning of the 17th century attempts
were made inside the fraternity, as the company societies
working in the same spirit may be called, to
bring to more general recognition a suitable name
for this company, which could also form a uniting
bond for the scattered single organizations. The
leaders knew and occasionally said that a respected
name for the common interest would be advantageous.
This view appears especially in the letters of
<pb n="192"/><anchor id="Pg192"/>
Comenius. It was then indeed an undecided question
what nation should place itself at the head of
the great undertaking. (Keller, in the M. H. der
C. G., 1895, p. 156.) <q>As a matter of fact precisely
in the years when in Germany the brothers
had won the support of powerful princes and the
movement received a great impetus, very decided
efforts were made both to create larger unions and
to adopt a unifying name. The founding of the
Society of the Palmtree [1617] was the result of the
earlier effort and the writings of Andreaes on the alleged
origin and aims of the rosicrucians are connected
with the other need. The battle of the White
Mountain and the unfortunate consequences that followed
killed both attempts, as it were, in the germ.</q>
(Z. Gesch, d. Bauh., p. 20.) Note by the way that
the name of the <q>Fraternity of the Red Cross</q> was
taken from symbols which were already employed
in the societies. In regard to this it is quite mistaken
accuracy to maintain that it was correctly called
<q>Bruderschaft des Rosenkreutz</q> and not <q>des
Rosenkreutzes,</q> as the <q>Handbuch d. Freimaurerei,</q>
p. 259, emends it. Vatter Christian Rosenkreutz
is indeed evidently only a composite legendary
personage as the bearer of a definite symbolism
(Christ, rose, cross), (and may have been devised
merely in jest). The name does not come from the
personality of the founder but the personality of
the founder comes from the name. The symbols
and expressions that lie at the foundations are the
earlier.
</p>

<pb n="193"/><anchor id="Pg193"/>

<p>
The attempt mentioned, to find a common name,
did not permanently succeed. The visionaries and
<q>heretics</q> decried as <q>Rosicrucians</q> and <q>alchymists</q>
were considered as enemies and persecuted.
It is irrelevant whether there was an organized fraternity
of rosicrucians; it was enough to be known as
a rosicrucian. (Keller, Z. Gesch. d. B., p. 21.)
The great organization did not take place until a
great European power spread over it its protecting
hand, i.e., in 1717, when in England the new English
system of <q>Grand Lodges of Free and Accepted
Masons</q> arose. (Keller, D. Soc. d. Hum., p. 18.)
We see that Keller arrives by another and surer
way than Katsch at the same result, and shows the
continuity of the alchemists or rosicrucians and the
later freemasons, if not in exactly the same way
that Katsch has outlined it. In particular Keller
gets along without the unproved statement that there
were organized rosicrucians (outside of the later
gold- and rose-crosses). He shows what is much
more important, namely that there were societies
that might have borne the name of rosicrucians (or
any similar name).

Several interesting peculiarities should not be
omitted, as for instance, that Leibniz, about 1667,
was secretary of an alchemist's society (of so-called
rosicrucians) in Nuremberg. Leibniz describes alchemy
as an <q>introduction to mystic theology</q> and
identifies the concepts of <q>Arcana Naturae</q> and
<q>Chymica.</q> (M. H. der C. G., 1903, p. 149;
1909, p. 169 ff.) In the laws of the grand lodge
<pb n="194"/><anchor id="Pg194"/>
<q>Indissolubilis</q> (17th and 18th centuries) there
are found as doctrinal symbols of the three grades,
the alchemistic symbols of salt (rectification, clarification),
of quicksilver (illumination), and of sulphur
(unification, tincture), used in a way that corresponds
to the stages of realization of the <q>Great
Work.</q> The M. H. d. C. G., 1909, p. 173 ff.
remarks that we should probably regard it only as
an accident, if there are not found, in the famous
hermetic chemical writings, similar signs with additions
as would for experts, exclude all doubt as to
their purport. In 1660 appeared at Paris an edition
of a writing very celebrated among the followers
of the art, <q>Twelve Keys of Philosophy,</q> which
was ostensibly written by one Brother Basilius Valentinus.
In this edition we see at the beginning a remarkable
plate, whose relation to masonic symbolism
is unmistakable (Figure 1). In addition to the lowest
symbol of salt (represented as cubic stone) there
is a significant reference to the earth and the earthly.
[I should note that besides [Symbol: circle with diameter line]
alchemy used [Symbol: square] for
salt, in which there is a special reference to the
earthly nature of salt. In Plato the smallest particles
of the earth are cubical. Salt and earth alternate
in the terminology, just as mercury [Symbol: female] and air [Symbol: air]
or water [Symbol: water] do; as sulphur [Symbol: sulfur
and fire [Symbol: fire]; only, however,
where it is permitted by the context.] The
Rectification of the subject (man) taken up by the
Art, is achieved through the purification of the
earthly elements according to the indication of the
alchemists who call the beginning of the work <q>Vitriol,</q>
<pb n="195"/><anchor id="Pg195"/>
and form an acrostic from the initial letters
of this word: <q>Visita Interiora Terrae, Rectificando
Invenies Occultum Lapidem</q> [= Visit the
interior of the earth; by purifying you will find the
hidden stone]. Half way up there floats the [Symbol: mercury]
that has the value of a <q>union symbol</q> in the brotherhoods
(as such, a symbol of fellowship) and left
and right of it is found the moon and sun or the
flaming star. Above is placed a triangle, in which
is a phoenix rising from the flames; and on the triangle
stands the crowned Saturn or Hermes (in
masonry Hiram). On the left and right of this
kingly form, on whose breast and stomach are placed
planet symbols, we notice water in the shape of
drops (tears) and flames that signify suffering and
resurrection. <q>When we notice that not only the
principles of the old <q>amateurs of the art</q> correspond
with those of the <q>royal art</q> [freemasonry],
but that the symbolism also is the same in all parts,
we recognize that the later masonic societies are only
a modern reshaping of the societies which dropped
the depreciated names of the alchemists in order to
appear in a new dress</q> (l. c., p. 175). That the assertion
of the complete similarity of the symbolism
is not mere fancy, the following considerations (and
not those only in this section), will satisfactorily
demonstrate. In the following examples the words
showing it most clearly are italicized.
</p>

<p>
Alchemy was regarded by its disciples as a <hi rend='italic'>royal
art</hi>. Old sources show that the art of making gold
was revealed in Egypt only to the crown princes.
<pb n="196"/><anchor id="Pg196"/>
Generally only the kings' sons were informed by the
priests concerning the magic sciences. The hermetics
derived their art expressly from kings,
Hermes, Geber, and the patriarchs of alchemy were
represented as kings.
</p>

<p>
According to Khunrath (Amphitheatrum) prayer,
work and perseverance lead to eternal wisdom by the
mystical ladder of the <hi rend='italic'>seven</hi>
theosophical <hi rend='italic'>steps</hi>.
Perfect wisdom consists in the knowledge of God
and his Son, in the understanding of the holy scriptures,
in self knowledge and in knowledge of the
great world and its Son, the Magnesia of the philosophers
or the Philosopher's Stone. The mystical
steps in general contain <hi rend='italic'>three</hi> activities, hearing
(audire), persevering (perseverare), knowing
(nosse et scire), that applies to <hi rend='italic'>five</hi> objects, so that
we can distinguish <hi rend='italic'>seven</hi> steps in all. Only the pure
may enter the temple of wisdom, only the <hi rend='italic'>worthy</hi>
are intrusted with the secrets, the <hi rend='italic'>profane</hi>, however,
must stay away.
</p>

<p>
In the fifth table of Khunrath's Amphitheatrum
is pictured the seven pillared citadel of Pallas
(Prov. IX, 1). At the entrance is a table with the
legend Opera bona (= good works). Behind sits
a man with the staff of Mercury. On each side is a
<hi rend='italic'>four sided pyramid</hi>, on the top of the left one is the
<hi rend='italic'>sun</hi>, on the right the <hi rend='italic'>moon</hi>.
On the former stands the word <hi rend='italic'>Fides</hi> (= faith),
on the latter <hi rend='italic'>Taciturnitas</hi>
(= silence). Behind the man we read the word
<hi rend='italic'>Mysterion</hi>, over the inner entrance
<hi rend='italic'>Non omnibus</hi> (= not for all).
</p>

<pb n="197"/><anchor id="Pg197"/>

<p>
Alchemy frequently mentions two or three <hi rend='italic'>lights</hi>.
By these it understood [Symbol: Sol] and [Symbol: Luna],
[Symbol: Venus], [Symbol: Mercury], [Symbol: Jupiter], light of
grace and light of nature, etc. The juxtaposition
of [Symbol: Sol] [Symbol: Luna] and [Symbol: Hexagram] is interesting; no one can attain
the desired end before, through the <hi rend='italic'>circular wheel</hi> of
the elements, the fatness or the blood of the <hi rend='italic'>sun</hi>,
and the dew of the <hi rend='italic'>moon</hi> are by the action of
<hi rend='italic'>art</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>nature</hi>, united in one body in
the image of the <hi rend='italic'>hexagram</hi>; and this can take place only by
the will of the <hi rend='italic'>Most High</hi>, who alone imparts the unique
boon of the <hi rend='italic'>Holy Ghost</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>priceless treasure</hi> according
to his especial mercy. The above mentioned
circular wheel is identical with the serpent that bites
its own tail; it is a power that always consumes and
always renews itself. This circle appears not to be
lacking in the flaming star; it is the round eye or the
likewise round fashioned <q>G,</q> which latter looks
quite similar to the snake hieroglyph. The reference
to Genesis has a good reason. Moreover, the
hexagram represents in cabbalistic sense the mystical
union of the male with the female potence [Symbol: Fire] with [Symbol: Water].
According to a rabbinical belief a picture is supposed
to be placed in the ark of the covenant alongside of
the tables of the laws, which shows a man and a
woman in intimate embrace, in the form of a hexagram.
In cabbalistic writings, as for instance, in
those of H. C. Agrippa, we find the human form in
a star, generally inscribed in the pentagram. The
genitals fall exactly in the middle part and are often
made prominent by an added [Symbol: Mercury] as male-female or
androgyne procreative power. One of the snake
<pb n="198"/><anchor id="Pg198"/>
shaped Egyptian hieroglyphs frequently turns into
an Arabic [Symbol: gimel], i.e., gimel. I do not know whether
this fact has any significance here. With respect to
the above passages that mention the <q>will of the
Most High,</q> I refer to the dialogue which concerns
the <q>G</q>; e.g., <q>Does it mean nothing else?</q>
<q>Something that is greater than you.</q> <q>Who is
greater than I?</q> etc. <q>It is Gott, whom the English
call God. Consider this mysterious star; it is
the symbol of the Spirit.... The image of the
holy fire, etc.</q>

REBIS is represented as an hermetic hermaphrodite.
The already mentioned figure with the two
heads (figure 2) is found (as Höhler relates) in a
book that appeared in Frankfort in 1618, called
<q>Joannes Danielis Mylii Tractatus III, seu Basilica
Philosophica,</q> though it is to be seen also in other
books on alchemy. The hermaphrodite stands on a
dragon that lies on a globe. In the right hand he
holds a <hi rend='italic'>pair of compasses</hi>, in the left a
<hi rend='italic'>square</hi>. On the globe we see a <hi rend='italic'>square</hi>
and a <hi rend='italic'>triangle</hi>. Around
the figure are the signs of the seven planets, with [Symbol: Mercury]
at the top. In a cut in the Discursus Nobilis of
John of Munster we see <hi rend='italic'>sun</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>moon</hi>,
at the middle of the top the <hi rend='italic'>star</hi> [Symbol: Hexagram],
also denoted by Y = γλζ
(= matter) surrounded by <hi rend='italic'>rays</hi>. (Höhler, Herm.
Phil., p. 105.)
</p>

<p>
In the cabala, which has found admission into
the idea of the alchemists and rosicrucians, no small
part is played by <hi rend='italic'>three pillars</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>two pillars</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Tubal Cain was renowned as a great alchemist.
<pb n="199"/><anchor id="Pg199"/>
He was the patriarch of wisdom, a master of all
kinds of brass and iron work. (Genesis IV, 22.)
He had the knowledge not only of ordinary chemistry
and of the fire required for it, but also of the
higher chemistry and of the hidden elemental fire.
After the flood there was no other man who knew
the art but the righteous Noah, whom some call
Hermogenes or Hermes, who possessed the knowledge
of celestial and terrestrial things.
</p>

<p>
One devoted to art must be a <hi rend='italic'>free man</hi> (Höhler,
l. c., p. 66). The <hi rend='italic'>ordinale</hi> of Norton establishes it
more or less as follows: <q>The kings in the olden
time have ordained that no one should learn the liberal
sciences except the free and those of noble spirit,
and any one who is devoted to them should devote
his life most freely. Accordingly the ancients have
called them the seven liberal arts, for whoever desires
to learn thoroughly and well must enjoy a certain
freedom.</q>

Very frequently one finds in the alchemists images
of <hi rend='italic'>death</hi>: grave, coffin, skeleton, etc. Thus in Michael
Maier's, Atalanta Fugiens, the Emblema
XLIV shows how the <hi rend='italic'>king</hi> lies with his crown in the
<hi rend='italic'>coffin</hi> which is just <hi rend='italic'>opened</hi>.
On the right stands a man with a turban, on the left two who open the
coffin and let his joyful countenance be seen. In the
Practica of Basilius Valentinus the illustration of
the fourth key shows a coffin, on which stands a skeleton,
the illustration of the eighth key (see Fig. 3),
a grave from which half emerges a man with upright
body and raised hands. [This reproduction
<pb n="200"/><anchor id="Pg200"/>
and figure I owe to the kindness of Dr. Ludwig
Keller and the publications of the Comenius Society.]
Two men are shooting at the well known
mark, [Symbol: Sol], here represented as a target (a symbol
much used in the old lodges), while a third is sowing.
(Parable of the sower and the seeds.) The
sign is a clever adaptation of the sulphur hieroglyph
and is identical with the registry mark of the third
degree of the Grand Lodge Indissolubilis. The
mark [Symbol: Half circle] on the wall is also a symbol of the academy;
it is the half circle, man, to whom the light is imparted
and means, when occurring collectively, the
fraternity. The evident idea is of representing the
exclusive society as enclosing wall. The angel with
the trumpet is the angel of the judgment day who
awakes the dead. With respect to the birds I refer
to Matthew XIII, 4: <q>And when he sowed, some
seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and
devoured them up.</q> In the text of Basilius Valentinus,
the fourth key, there is mention of the rotting
and falling to pieces with which we are familiar.
The idea of dismemberment is not infrequently
clearly expressed, more clearly than in our parable.
Already in the oldest alchemistic manuals one operation
is called the grave of Osiris. One of the
manuscripts cited by Berthelot (Orig., p. 60) says:
<q>The dragon is the <hi rend='italic'>guardian of the temple</hi>, sacrifice
him, <hi rend='italic'>flay</hi> him, cut his <hi rend='italic'>flesh</hi>
from his <hi rend='italic'>bones</hi> and thou
wilt find what thou seekest.</q> The dragon is also
called Osiris, with whose <hi rend='italic'>son</hi> Horus-Harpocrates,
the skillful Hermes, is also identified. (Do we need
<pb n="201"/><anchor id="Pg201"/>
reference to requirements in the 3d degree? J ...
left his skin; ... B ... left his flesh...;
M ... B..., he lives in the Son.)
</p>

<p>
Here more clearly than anywhere else we see the
masonic symbolism combined with the myth of the
first parents or creation myth. No matter where
it acts, the myth-making power never seems willing
to belie its laws. Also the tree growing out of the
grave or the body of the dead ancestor is not wanting.
(<q>... at the graves of our fathers.</q> <q>I
was accused of a terrible crime.</q>) It is the acacia
whose presence is rationalized apparently for the
purpose of forming a sign by which to find again the
place of the hastily buried.
</p>

<p>
An Egyptian fable tells of two brothers. The
younger, Bata, was <hi rend='italic'>falsely accused</hi> by his sister-in-law
(as was Joseph by Potiphar's wife). His
brother Inpw (Anepu) consequently pursued him.
The sun god made a mighty flood that separated the
pursuer from the pursued. Bata castrated himself
and threw his organ of generation into the water,
where it was swallowed by a fish. Bata's heart later
in the story is changed into a blossom of an acacia
or a cedar. [I naturally lay no stress on the accident
that the acacia occurs here. The point is that
the tree is a symbol of life.] Bata is reconciled
with Inpw and at parting relates to him that a mug
of beer is to serve as a symbol of how the brother
fares, who is dwelling afar off. If the beer foams
he is in danger. Bata's wife has the acacia tree, on
which Bata's heart is a blossom, felled, and as a
<pb n="202"/><anchor id="Pg202"/>
result Bata dies. By means of the mug Inpw learns
of Bata's peril and departs to look for his younger
brother. Inpw <hi rend='italic'>finds the fallen acacia</hi> and on it a
berry that is the heart of his brother transformed.
Bata <hi rend='italic'>comes to life again</hi> and transforms himself
into an ox. His wife has the ox butchered on the
pretext of wishing to eat its liver. Two drops of
blood fall from the cut throat of the ox upon the
ground and are changed into two peach trees.
Bata's wife has the two peach trees felled. A chip
flies into her mouth. She swallows it and becomes
pregnant by it. The child that she bears is the
reincarnated Bata. He therefore <hi rend='italic'>lives again in his
son as the child of a widow</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The second fragment of the Physica et Mystica
of Pseudo Democritus, that Berthelot cites (Orig.,
p. 151) relates that the <hi rend='italic'>master died without having
initiated Democritus into the secrets of knowledge</hi>.
Democritus conjured him up out of the underworld.
The spirit cried: <q>So that is the reward I get for
what I have done for thee.</q> To the questions of
Democritus he answered, <q>The books are in the
temple.</q> They were not found. Some time thereafter,
on the occasion of a festival, they saw a
<hi rend='italic'>column</hi> crack open, and in the opening they found
the books of the master, which contained three mystic
axioms: <q>Nature pleases herself in Nature;
Nature triumphs over Nature; Nature governs Nature.</q>
</p>

<p>
The quotations show, to be sure, only superficially
the interrelation of alchemy and freemasonry. The
<pb n="203"/><anchor id="Pg203"/>
actual affinity lying behind the symbolism, which,
moreover, our examination of the hermetic art has
already foreshadowed, will be treated later.
</p>

<p>
We could also posit a psychological interrelation
in the form of an <q>etiological assumption</q> according
to the terminology of psychoanalysis. It would
explain the temporary fusion of alchemistic rosicrucianism
with freemasonry. The rosicrucian frenzy
would never have occurred&mdash;so much I will say&mdash;in
masonry, if there had been no trend that way.
Some emotional cause must have existed for the phenomenon,
and as the specter of rosicrucianism stalked
especially on the masonic stage, and indeed was dangerous
to it alone, this etiological assumption must
be such as to furnish an effective factor in masonry
itself, only in more discreet and wholesome form.
In masonry psychological elements have played a
part which if improperly managed might degenerate,
as indeed they did when gold- and rose-crossism was
grafted on masonry. It appears to me too superficial
to explain the movement merely from the external
connection of rosicrucianism and the masonic
system. Although the observation is quite just, it
does not touch the kernel of the matter, the impulse,
which only psychology can lay bare. Freemasonry
must have felt some affinity with rosicrucianism,
something related at the psychical basis of the mode
of expression (symbolism, ritual) of both. Only
the modes of expression of rosicrucianism are evidently
more far reaching or more dangerous in the
sense that they (the leadership of loose companions
<pb n="204"/><anchor id="Pg204"/>
always presupposed) could sooner incite weaker
characters to a perverted idea and practice of it.
</p>

<p>
That rosicrucianism in its better aspect is identical
with the higher alchemy, can no longer be doubted
by any one after the material here offered. The
common psychological element is shown when, as
will be done in later parts of this book, we go into
the deeper common basis of alchemy and freemasonry.
Then first will the sought-for <q>etiological
assumption</q> attain to its desired clearness. But
already this much may be clear: that we have in
both domains, structures with a religious content,
even though from time to time names are used which
will veil these facts. I add now in anticipation a
statement whose clear summing up has been reserved
for psychoanalysis, namely that the object of religious
worship is regularly to be regarded as a symbol
of the libido, that psychologic goddess who rules
the desires of mankind&mdash;and whose prime minister
is Eros. [Libido is desire or the tendency toward
desire, as it controls our impulsive life. In medical
language used mainly for sexual desire, the concept
of libido is extended in psychoanalysis (namely
by C. G. Jung) to the impelling power of psychic
phenomena in general. Libido would therefore be
the inner view of what must in objective description
be called <q>psychic energy.</q> How it could be given
this extension of meaning is seen when we know the
possibilities of its transformation and sublimation,
a matter which will be treated later.] Now if the
libido symbol raised up for an ideal is placed too
<pb n="205"/><anchor id="Pg205"/>
nakedly before the seeker, the danger of misunderstanding
and perversion is always present. For he
is misled by his instincts to take the symbol verbally,
that is, in its original, baser sense and to act accordingly.
So all religions are degenerate in which one
chooses as a libido symbol the unconcealed sexual
act, and therefore also a religion must degenerate,
in which gold, this object of inordinate desire, is
used as a symbol.
</p>

<p>
What impels the seeker, that is, the man who
actually deserves the name, in masonry and in alchemy,
is clearly manifested as a certain dissatisfaction.
The seeker is not satisfied with what he
actually learns in the degrees, he expects more, wants
to have more exhaustive information, wants to know
when the <q>real</q> will be finally shown. Complaint
is made, for example, of the narrowness of the meaning
of the degrees of fellowship. Much more important
than the objective meaning of any degree
is the subjective wealth of the thing to be promoted.
The less this is, the less will he <q>find</q> even in the
degrees, and the less satisfied will he be, in case he
succeeds in attaining anything at all. To act here
in a compensating way is naturally the task of the
persons that induce him. But it is the before mentioned
dissatisfaction, too, which causes one to expect
wonderful arts from the superiors of the higher
degrees; an expectation that gives a fine opportunity
for exploitation by swindlers who, of course, have
not been lacking in the province of alchemy, exactly
as later at a more critical time, in the high degree
<pb n="206"/><anchor id="Pg206"/>
masonry. Who can exactly determine how great a
part may have been played by avarice, ambition,
vanity, curiosity, and finally by a not unpraiseworthy
emotional hunger?
</p>

<p>
The speculators who fished in the muddy waters
of late rosicrucianism put many desirable things as
bait on the hook; as power over the world of spirits,
penetration into the most recondite parts of nature's
teachings, honor, riches, health, longevity. In one
was aroused the hope of one of these aims, in another
of another. The belief in gold making was, as already
mentioned, still alive at that period. But it
was not only the continuance of this conviction that
caused belief in the alchemistic secrets of the high
degrees, but, as for instance, B. Kopp shows (Alch.
II, p. 13) it was a certain metaphysical need of the
time.
</p>

<p>
It will have been noticed that with all recognition
of its abuses I grant to rosicrucianism, as it deserves,
even its later forms, an ideal side. To deny it were
to falsify its true likeness. Only the important difference
must be noted between an idea and its advocates
alchemy and the alchemists, rosicrucianism and
the rosicrucians. There are worthy and unworthy
advocates; among the alchemists they are called the
adepts or masters and the sloppers and sloppy workers.
Since in our research we are concerned with
the hermetic science itself, not merely with the misdirections
undertaken in its name, we should not let
ourselves be involved in these. And as for us the
<pb n="207"/><anchor id="Pg207"/>
spiritual result (alchemy, rosicrucian thoughts, masonic
symbolism, etc.) is primarily to be regarded
and not the single persons advocating it, the question
is idle as to whether the earliest rosicrucians had an
organized union or not. It is enough that the rosicrucians
are created in the imagination, that this
imagination is fostered and that people live it out
and make it real. It amounts to the same thing for
us, whether there were <q>so-called</q> or <q>real</q> rosicrucians;
the substance of their teaching lives and
this substance, which is evident in literature, was
what I referred to when I said that rosicrucianism
is identical with higher alchemy or the hermetic or
the royal art. But I think the comparison holds
true for the gold and rose-cross societies also, for
the spiritual scope of this new edition is the same
as that of the old order, except that, as in the fate
of all subtile things, it was misunderstood by the majority.
There were not lacking attempts to dissuade
people from their errors. In the rosicrucian notes
to the <q>Kompass der Weisen</q> (edition of 1782),
e.g., <q>Moreover the object of our guiltless guild is
not the making of gold.... Rather we remove the
erroneous opinion from them [the disciples] in so
far as they are infected with it, even on the first step
of the temple of wisdom. They are earnestly enjoined
against these errors and that they must seek
the kingdom of God and his righteousness.</q> Also
through all kinds of reforms we seek to set the wayfarer
on the right path that leads to the original
<pb n="208"/><anchor id="Pg208"/>
ideal. It appears that the alchemistic preparation
of the <q>work</q> is available only for the smallest
circles. The multitude is blinded.

<head>The Problem Of Multiple Interpretation.</head>

<p>
After what has been said it is clear that the Parable
contains instruction in the sense of the higher
alchemy. Whoever has attentively read this 4th
chapter will certainly be in a position to understand
the parable, in large part, in a hermetic sense. I do
not wish to develop this interpretation now, for to a
certain extent it develops itself without further effort,
and what goes beyond that can be treated only
in the second part of this volume. I shall limit myself
now to a few suggestions.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the external setting of the parable as
a piece of rosicrucian literature, we must remember
that it was published in 1788, the time of the later
gold- and rose-cross societies, and in a book whose
theosophic and religious character is seen in all the
figures contained in it as well as in the greater part
of the text. It is continually reiterated that gold is
not common gold but our gold, that the stone is a
spiritual stone (Jesus Christ), etc. The creation of
the world, the religious duty of mankind, the mystic
path to the experiencing of divinity&mdash;all is represented
in detailed pictures with predominantly chemical
symbolism. This higher conception of alchemy,
<pb n="210"/><anchor id="Pg210"/>
that corresponds throughout to the ideal of the so-called
old or true rosicrucian, does not prevent the
editor from believing in the possibility of miraculous
gifts which are to be gained through the hermetic
art. Many parts of the book make us suspect a
certain naïveté that may go several degrees beyond
the simplicity required for religious development.
</p>

<p>
As for the origin of the parable there are two
possibilities. Either the editor is himself the author
and as such retires into the background, while
he acts as collector of old rosicrucian manuscripts,
that he now in publishing, discloses to amateurs in
the art, or the editor is merely editor. In either
case the obligation remains to interpret the parable
hermetically. The educational purpose of the editor
is established. If he is himself the author, he himself
has clothed his teachings in the images of the
parable. If, on the contrary, the author is some
one else (either a contemporary and so [Symbol: sun] R. C. [Symbol: cross],
or an old hermetic philosopher, Fr. R. C.), the
editor has found in the piece edited by him a subject
suitable to his purpose, a material that voices
his doctrines. We can evidently also rest satisfied,
in order to evade the question of authorship, that
the writing itself gets its own character from the
hermetic interpretations, and shows in detail its correspondingly
theosophic material. Nevertheless I
desire to show the directing hand of the collector
and editor.
</p>

<p>
Several controlling elements pointing toward a
hermetic theosophic interpretation, which the reader
<pb n="211"/><anchor id="Pg211"/>
probably looks for in the parable, may be shown if
I mention the ethical purposes that here and there
emerge in our psychoanalytic interpretation of the
parable. I might remind the reader that the wanderer
is a killer of dragons like St. George; the
holy Mary is represented standing over a dragon;
also under the Buddha enthroned upon a lotus
flower, there curls not infrequently a vanquished
dragon; etc. I might mention the religious symbolism
of the narrow path that leads to the true
life. Many occurrences in the parable are to be
conceived as trials, and we can see the wanderer
overcome the elemental world (Nature triumphs
over Nature), wherein he is proved by all four elements
and comes off victorious from all tests. The
fight with the lion in the den can be regarded as a
world test, the walk on the cloud capped wall (like
the flying up in the vessel) as an air test, the mill
episode (and the flood in the vessel) as a water
ordeal, and the stay in the heated vessel as a fire
ordeal. The old miller is God, the ten mill wheels
are the ten commandments, and likewise the ten
Sephiroth that create the whole world. We are also
reminded of the Ophanim (wheels, a class of angels).
</p>

<p>
Several particulars suggest the admission of the
seeker into a hermetic fraternity, which, as far as I
am concerned, might be called rosicrucian. There
was also among the cabbalists, as apparently is shown
by Reuchlin (De Vero Mirifico), an initiation into
a mystery. Fludd (in his Tractatus theologo-philosophicus
<pb n="212"/><anchor id="Pg212"/>
de vita, morte et resurrectione, Chap. XVI)
apostrophizes the rosicrucians: <q>With open eyes I
saw from your brief answer to two men whom you
intended, at the exhortation of the Holy Ghost, to
choose to your cloister or house, that you possessed
the same knowledge of the true mystery and the same
keys of knowledge that unlock the Paradise of Joy,
as the patriarchs and prophets of holy scripture possess.</q>
And in another place, <q>Believe that your
(the R. C. [Symbol: cross]) palace or abode is situated at the confines
of the earthly paradise [locus voluptatis terrestris]....</q>
In our parable it is a paradise of joy
[pratum felicitatis] where the wanderer meets the
company into which he desires admission. He must
undergo examinations like every neophyte. The
collegium sapientiae of the parable refers to the
rosicrucian Collegium Sancti Spiritus, which is
actually named in another passage of the book that
contains the parable.
</p>

<p>
The blood of the lion, which the wanderer gets
by cutting him up, refers to the rose-colored blood
of the cross that we gain through deep digging and
hammering. The wanderer picks roses and puts
them in his hat, a mark of honor. The master is
generally seen provided with a hat in the old pictures.
<q>Rose garden</q> (the garden of the parable
is quadrangular) was a name applied apparently to
alchemistic lodges. The philosophical work itself
is compared to the rose; the white rose is the white
tincture, the red rose is the red tincture (different
degrees of completion that follow the degrees of
<pb n="213"/><anchor id="Pg213"/>
black). They are plucked in the <q>alchemistic paradise,</q>
but one must set about it in obedience to nature.
Basilius Valentinus in the third of his twelve
keys writes of the great magisterium: <q>So whoever
wishes to compare our incombustible sulphur
of all the wise men, must first take heed for himself,
that he look for our sulphur in one who is inwardly
incombustible; which cannot occur unless the salt sea
has swallowed the corpse and completely cast it up
again. Then raise it in its degree, so that it surpass
in brilliance all the stars of heaven, and become
in its nature as rich in blood, as the pelican when he
wounds himself in his breast, so that his young may
be well nourished without malady to his body, and
can eat of his blood. [The pelican possesses under
its bill a great pouch in which he can preserve food,
principally fish. If he regurgitates the food out of
his crop to feed his young he rests his bill against
his breast. That gave rise to the belief that it tore
open its breast in order to feed its young with its
blood. From early times the pelican is therefore
used as a symbol of Christ, who shed his blood for
mankind. The alchemists represented the philosopher's
stone, the red tincture, as a pelican; for by
its projection on the baser metals it sacrificed itself
and, as it were, gave its blood to tincture them.
The Christian and the hermetic symbolism are concurrent
as in higher sense the stone Christ, i.e., the
Messiah, is on our hearts.] That is the rose of our
master with color of scarlet and red dragon's blood,
written of by many, also the purple mantle of the
<pb n="214"/><anchor id="Pg214"/>
highest commanders in our art, with which the Queen
of Salvation is clothed, and by which all the poor
metals can be warmed. Keep well this mantle of
honor.</q>
</p>

<p>
It is interesting that dream parallels can support
us in both directions on the path of hermetic interpretation.
I have in the second section of this volume
reported the <q>dream of the Flying Post.</q> I
must now complete its interpretation. Stekel writes
(l. c, p. 399): <q>If we examine the birth and
uterus phantasies, Mr. X. Z., the dreamer, turns
out to be a base criminal. He struggles with conscious
murder ideas. He is afraid he may kill his
uncle or his mother. He is very pious. But his
soul is black as the coal-dust-strewn street. His evil
thoughts (the homosexual) pursue him. He enters
the mill. It is God's mill that grinds slowly but
surely. His weight (his burden of sin) drives the
mill. He is expelled. He enters the Flying Post.
It is the post that unites heaven and earth. He is
to pay, i.e., do penance for his sins. His sins are
erotic (three heller = the genitals). His sins and
misdeeds stink before heaven (dirty feet). The
conductor is death.... The wheel room refers to
the wheel of criminals. The water is blood.</q> The
perilous situation in the dream, God's mill, the blackness,
the water or blood, which are their analogues,
are found in the parable without further reference
being necessary. Especially would I select the unusual
detail of the stinking, dirty feet, for which
probably no one would see any association in the
<pb n="215"/><anchor id="Pg215"/>
parable. It is found in the episode of the rotting
of the bridal pair in the receptacle. It is expressly
stated that the putrefying corpses (i.e., the disintegrating
sinful bodies of men in the theosophic work)
stink. The opposite is the odor of sanctity. Actually
this opposition recurs frequently in hermetic
manuals. The conductor in the dream is described
hermetically as a messenger of heaven [Symbol: mercury], Hermes,
conveyor of souls. His first appearance in the life
of man is conscience. This causes our sins, which
would be otherwise indifferent, to stink. In alchemy
the substances stink on their dissolution in mercurious
purifying liquid. Only later does the agreeable
fragrance appear.
</p>

<p>
If we find on the one hand that the parable appears
as a hermetic writing, which allows us to develop
theosophical principles from its chemical
analogues, on the other hand the psychoanalytic
interpretation is not thereby shaken. Consequently
the question arises for us how it is possible to give
several interpretations of a long series of symbols
that stand in complete opposition. [If we were
concerned with individual symbols merely, the matter
would not be at all extraordinary.] Our research
has shown that they are possible. The psychoanalytic
interpretation brings to view elements of
a purposeless and irrational life of impulse, which
works out its fury in the phantasies of the parable;
and now the analysis of hermetic writings shows us
that the parable, like all deep alchemistic books, is
an introduction to a mystic religious life,&mdash;according
<pb n="216"/><anchor id="Pg216"/>
to the degree of clearness with which the ideas hovered
before the author. For just as the psychoanalytically
derived meaning of the phantasies does not
occur to him, so possibly even the mystical way on
which he must travel must have appeared only hazily
before him. So no matter what degree of clearness
the subjective experience may have had from the author's
point of view, we have for the solution of our
own problem, to stick to the given object and to the
possibilities of interpretation that are so extraordinarily
coherent.
</p>

<p>
The interpretations are really three; the psychoanalytic,
which leads us to the depths of the impulsive
life; then the vividly contrasting hermetic religious
one, which, as it were, leads us up to high
ideals and which I shall call shortly the anagogic;
and third, the chemical (natural philosophical),
which, so to speak, lies midway and, in contrast to
the two others, appears ethically indifferent. The
third meaning of this work of imagination lies in
different relations half way between the psychoanalytic
and the anagogic, and can, as alchemistic literature
shows, be conceived as the bearer of the anagogic.
</p>

<p>
The parable may serve as an academic illustration
for the entire hermetic (philosophy). The problem
of multiple interpretation is quite universal, in the
sense namely that one encounters it everywhere
where the imagination is creatively active. So our
study opens wide fields and art and mythology especially
appear to invite us. I will depart as little as
<pb n="217"/><anchor id="Pg217"/>
possible, however, from the province chosen as an
example, i.e., alchemy. But in two fables I shall
work out the problem of multiple interpretation.
In the choice of the fables I am influenced by the
fact that a psychoanalytic elaboration (Rank's) lies
ready to hand, and that both are subjected to an
anagogic interpretation by Hitchcock, who wrote the
book on alchemy. This enables me to take the matter
up briefly because I can simply refer to the detailed
treatment in the above mentioned books.
The two stories belong to Grimm's collection and
are called the Six Swans, and the Three Feathers.
(K. H. M., Nos. 49 and 63.)
</p>

<p>
Rank (Lohenginsage) connects the story of the
six swans and numerous similar stories with the
knight of the swan saga. It is shown that the mythical
contents of all these narratives have at bottom
those elemental forces of the impulse life that we
have found in the parable, and that they are specially
founded on family conflicts, i.e., on those uncontrolled
love and hate motives that come out in
their crassest form in the neurotic as his (phantasied)
<q>family romance.</q> To this family romance
belongs, among others, incest in different forms, the
illicit love for the mother, the rescuing of the mother
from peril, the rescuing of the father, the wish to
be the father, etc., phantasies whose meaning is explained
in the writings of Freud and Rank (Myth
of the Birth of the Hero<note place='foot'>Nervous and Mental Disease
Monograph Series. Tr. by Jelliffe.</note>). According to Hitchcock,
<pb n="218"/><anchor id="Pg218"/>
on the contrary, the same story tells of a man
who in the decline of life falls into error, takes the
sin to his heart, but then, counseled by his conscience,
seeks his better self and completes the (alchemic-creative)
work of the six days. (Hitchcock, Red
Book.)
</p>

<p>
It is incontestable that there is, besides the psychoanalytic
and anagogic interpretation of this tale (and
almost all others), a nature mythological and in the
special sense, an astronomical interpretation. Significant
indications of this are the seven children and
the seven years, the sewing of clothes made of star
flowers, the lack of an arm as in the case of Marduk,
and the corresponding heroes of astral myths, and
many others. One of the seven is particularly distinguished
like the sun among the so-called planets.
The ethically indifferent meaning of the tale alongside
of the psychoanalytic and the anagogic corresponds
to the chemical contents of the hermetic writings.
As object of the indifferent meaning there
always stands the natural science content of the
spirit's creation. There is generally a certain relationship
between the astronomical and the alchemistic
meanings. It is now well known that alchemy
was influenced by astrology, that the seven metals
correspond to the seven planets, that, as the sun is
distinguished among the planets, so is gold among
the metals; and as in astrology combustion takes
place in heaven, so it occurs also in the alembic of
the alchemists. And the fact that the sun maiden
at the end of the story releases her six planet brothers,
<pb n="219"/><anchor id="Pg219"/>
sounds exactly as when the tincturing power of
gold at the end of six days perfects the six imperfect
metals and makes the ill, well.
</p>

<p>
In the second story I will emphasize to a somewhat
greater degree the opposition of the two contrasting
interpretations (psychoanalytic and anagogic),
as I must return to it again. The story is
suited to a detailed treatment on account of its brevity.
I will first present it.
</p>

<p>
There was once a king who had three sons, two
of whom were clever and shrewd, but the third did
not talk much, was simple and was merely called
the Simpleton. When the king grew old and feeble
and expected his end, he did not know which one of
his sons should inherit the kingdom after him. So
he said to them, <q>Go forth, and whoever brings me
the finest carpet shall be king after my death.</q> And
lest there be any disagreement among them, he led
them before his castle, blew three feathers into the
air, and said: <q>As they fly, so shall you go.</q> One
flew towards the east, the other towards the west, the
third, however, flew straight ahead, but flying only
a short distance soon fell to earth. Now one
brother went to the right, the other went to the left,
and they laughed at Simpleton, who had to stay
with the third feather where it had fallen.
</p>

<p>
Simpleton sat down and was sad. Suddenly he
noticed that near the feather lay a trap door. He
raised it, found a stairway, and went down. Then
he came before another door, knocked and listened,
while inside a voice called:
</p>

<pb n="220"/><anchor id="Pg220"/>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Maiden green and small,</q></l>
<l>Shrunken old crone,</l>
<l>Old crone's little dog,</l>
<l>Crone here and there,</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Let us see quickly who is out there.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
The door opened and he saw a big fat toad and
round about her a crowd of little toads. The fat
toad asked what his wish was. He answered, <q>I
should have liked the most beautiful and finest carpet.</q>
Then she called a young one and said:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Maiden green and small,</q></l>
<l>Shrunken old crone,</l>
<l>Crone's little dog,</l>
<l>Crone here and there,</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Fetch here the big box.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
The young toad brought the box and the fat toad
opened it and gave Simpleton a carpet from it, so
beautiful and so fine as up above on the earth could
not have been woven. Then he thanked her and
climbed up again.
</p>

<p>
The two others had, however, considered their
youngest brother so weak-minded that they believed
that he would not find and bring anything back.
<q>Why should we take so much trouble,</q> said they,
and took from the back of the first shepherd's wife
that met them her coarse shawl and carried it home
to the king. At the same time Simpleton returned
and brought his beautiful carpet, and when the king
saw it he was astonished and said: <q>If justice must
be done, the kingdom belongs to the youngest.</q>
</p>

<pb n="221"/><anchor id="Pg221"/>

<p>
But the two others gave their father no peace, and
said that it was impossible that Simpleton, who
lacked understanding in all things, could be a king,
and begged him to make a new condition. Then the
father said, <q>The one that brings me the most beautiful
ring shall be king,</q> led the three brothers out
and blew three feathers into the air for them to follow.
The two oldest again went east and west, and
Simpleton's feather flew straight ahead and fell down
near the door in the earth. So he went down again
to the fat toad and told her that he needed the most
beautiful ring. She immediately had her big box
fetched and from it gave him a ring that glittered
with jewels and was more beautiful than any goldsmith
upon the earth could have made. The two
eldest laughed about Simpleton, who was going to
look for a gold ring, but they took no trouble, and
knocked the pin out of an old wagon ring and
brought the ring to the king. But when Simpleton
showed his gold ring the father again said, <q>The
kingdom belongs to him.</q> The two eldest did not
cease importuning the king till he made a third condition
and declared that the kingdom should go to
the one that brought home the fairest woman.
Again he blew the three feathers into the air and
they flew as before.
</p>

<p>
So Simpleton without more ado went down to the
fat toad and said, <q>I have to take home the fairest
woman.</q> <q>The fairest woman, hey? She is not
right here, but none the less you shall have her.</q>
She gave him a hollowed out carrot to which were
<pb n="222"/><anchor id="Pg222"/>
harnessed six little mice. Then Simpleton sadly
said, <q>What shall I do with it?</q> The toad replied,
<q>Just put one of my little toads in it.</q> So he took
one by chance from the circle and put it in the yellow
carriage, but hardly had she taken her seat when she
became a surpassingly beautiful maiden, the carrot
a coach, and the six little mice, horses. So he kissed
the maiden, drove away with the horses and took
them to the king. His brothers came afterwards.
They had not taken any trouble to find a fair lady but
had brought the first good looking peasant woman.
As the king looked at them he said, <q>The youngest
gets the kingdom after my death.</q> But the two
oldest deafened the king's ears with their outcry:
<q>We cannot allow the Simpleton to be king,</q> and
gained his consent that the one whose woman should
jump through a ring that hung in the middle of the
room should have the preference. They thought,
<q>The peasant women can do it easily, they are
strong enough, but the delicate miss will jump herself
to death.</q> The old king consented to this also.
So the two peasant women jumped, even jumped
through the ring, but were so clumsy that they fell
and broke their awkward arms and legs. Then the
beautiful woman whom Simpleton had brought
leaped through as easily as a roe, and all opposition
had to cease. So he received the crown and ruled
long and wisely.
</p>

<p>
I offer first a neat psychoanalytic interpretation
of this narrative. Like the dream, the fairy tale is
regularly a phantastic fulfillment of wishes, and, of
<pb n="223"/><anchor id="Pg223"/>
such indeed, as we realize, but which life does not
satisfy, as well as of such as we are hardly aware
of in consciousness, and would not entertain if we
knew them clearly. Reality denies much, especially
to the weak, or to those who feel themselves weak,
or who have a smaller capacity for work in the struggle
for existence in relation to their fellow men.
The efficient person accomplishes in his life what he
wishes, the wishes of the weak remain unfulfilled,
and for this reason the weak, or whoever in comparison
with the magnitude of his desires, thinks
himself weak, avails himself of the phantastic wish
fulfillment. He desires to attain the unattainable
at least in imagination. This is the psychological
reason why so many fairy stories are composed from
the standpoint of the weak, so that the experiencing
Ego of the fairy tale, the hero, is a simpleton, the
smallest or the weakest or the youngest one who is
oppressed, etc. The hero of the foregoing tale is
a simpleton and the youngest. In his phantasy, that
is, in the story, he stamps his brothers, who are in
real life more efficient, and whom he envies, as malicious,
disagreeable characters. (In real life we
can generally observe how suspicious are, for instance,
physically deformed people. Their sensitiveness
is well known.) Like the fox to whom the
grapes are sour, he declares that what his stronger
fellows accomplish is bad, their performance of their
duty defective, and their aims contemptible, especially
in the sexual sphere, where he feels himself
openly most injured. The tale treats specifically
<pb n="224"/><anchor id="Pg224"/>
from the outset the conquest of a woman. The carpet,
the ring, are female symbols, the first is the body
of the woman, the ring is the vagina (Greek kteis
= comb = pudenda muliebria). (The carpet is
still more specifically marked as a female symbol in
that the brothers take it from the body of a shepherdess.
Shepherdess&mdash;a coarse <q>rag</q>&mdash;coarse
<q>cloth</q>&mdash;in contrast to the fine carpet of the hero.)
</p>

<p>
The simpleton is one who does not like much
work. When he also ascribes negligence to his
brothers he betrays to us his own nature, in that his
<q>feather,</q> i.e., himself, does not go far, while his
brothers' feathers go some distance. In order to
invalidate this view of himself the distribution of
the feathers is put off on chance, as if to a higher
determining power. This has always been a favorite
excuse with lazy and inefficient people.
</p>

<p>
One of the means of consoling himself for the unattainableness
of his wishes is the belief in miracles.
(Cf. my work on Phantasy and Mythos.) The simpleton
gains his advantage in a miraculous manner;
roasted pigeons fly into his mouth.
</p>

<p>
In his erotic enterprises he sticks to his own immediate
neighborhood. He clearly bears within himself
an Imago that holds him fast. [This is an
image, withdrawn from consciousness and consequently
indestructible, of the object of one's earliest
passion, which continues to operate as a strongly affective
complex, and takes hold upon life with a formative
effect. The most powerful Imagos are those
of the parents. Here naturally the mother imago
<pb n="225"/><anchor id="Pg225"/>
comes to view, which later takes a position in the center
of the love life (namely the choice of object).]
Whither does he turn for his journey of conquest?
Into the earth. The earth is the mother as a familiar
symbol language teaches us. Trap door, box,
subterranean holes, suggest a womb phantasy. The
toad frequently appears with the significance of the
uterus, harmonizing with the situation that the tale
presents. (On the contrary frog is usually penis.)
The toad's big box (= mother) is also the womb.
From it indeed the female symbols, in this connection,
sisters, are produced for the simpleton. The
box is, however, also the domestic cupboard,&mdash;food
closet, parcel, bandbox, chamber, bowl, etc.,&mdash;from
which the good mother hands out tasty gifts, toys,
etc. Just as the father in childish phantasy can do
anything, so the mother has a box out of which she
takes all kinds of good gifts for the children. Down
among the toads an ideal family episode is enacted.
The mother's inexhaustible box (with the double
meaning) even delivers the desired woman for the
simpleton.
</p>

<p>
The woman&mdash;for whom? Doubtless for the
simpleton, psychologically. The tale says for the
king, because the female symbols, carpet, ring, the
king desires for himself, in so many words, and the
inference is that the woman also belongs to him.
The conclusion of the tale, however, turns out true
to the psychological situation, as it does away with
the king and lets the simpleton live on, apparently
with the same woman. It is clear as day that the
<pb n="226"/><anchor id="Pg226"/>
simpleton identifies himself with his father, places
himself in his place. The image, which possesses
him from the first is the father's woman, the mother.
And the father's death&mdash;that is considerately ignored&mdash;which
brings queen and crown, is a wish
of the simpleton. So again we find ourselves at the
center of the Œdipus complex. As mother-substitute
figures the sister, one of the little toads.
</p>

<p>
We have regarded the story first from the point
of view of the inefficiency of the hero, and have
thereupon stumbled upon erotic relations, finally
upon the Œdipus complex. The psychological connection
results from the fact that those images on
which the Œdipus complex is constructed appear calculated
to produce an inefficiency in the erotic life.
</p>

<p>
The anagogic interpretation of Hitchcock (l. c.,
pp. 175 ff.) is as follows, though somewhat
abridged:
</p>

<p>
The king plainly means man. He has three sons;
he is an image of the Trinity, which in the sense of
our presentation we shall think of as body, soul and
spirit. Two of the sons were wise in the worldly
sense, but the third, who represents spirit and in the
primitive form, is called conscience, is simple in order
to typify the straight and narrow path of truth.
The spirit leads in sacred silence those who meekly
follow it and dies in a mystical sense if it is denied,
or else appears in other forms in order to pursue
the soul with the ghosts of murdered virtues. Man
is, as it were, in doubt concerning the principle to
which the highest leadership in life is due. <q>Go
<pb n="227"/><anchor id="Pg227"/>
forth and whoever brings me the finest carpet shall
be king after my death.</q> The carpet is something
on which one walks or stands, here representing the
best way of life according to Isaiah XXX, 21. <q>This
is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right
hand and when ye turn to the left.</q>
</p>

<p>
The three feathers are, of course, the three principles.
Two of them move at once in opposite directions
[towards the east and towards the west, as
many writers on alchemy represent the two principles
or breaths, anima and corpus or [Symbol: Gold] and [Symbol: Silver]]
and so come even at the outset away from the right
path. The third, symbol of the spirit, flies straight
forward and has not far to its end, for simple is
the way to the inner life. And so the spirit will
speak to us if we follow its voice, at first quite a
faint voice: <q>But the word is very nigh unto thee,
in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayst do it.</q>
(Deuteronomy XXX, 14.) Yet the soul is not free
from sadness, as the man stands still on the lower
steps of the ladder that leads up into eternal life.
Simpleton is troubled in his heart and in the humility
of this affliction he discovers <q>all at once</q> a secret
door, which shows him the entrance into the mystical
life. The door is on the surface of the earth, in
abasement, as the third feather determined it in
advance. As Simpleton discreetly obeyed it, he
strolled along the path that the door opened for him.
Three steps, three fundamental forces. So Christ
had to descend before he could rise. The hero of
the story knocks as Christ knocks in the gospel (i.e.,
<pb n="228"/><anchor id="Pg228"/>
on the inner door, contrasted with the law of Moses,
the outer door). The big toad with her little ones
in a circle about her signifies the great mother nature
and her creatures, which surround her in a circle;
in a circle, for nature always returns upon herself
in a cycle. Simpleton gets the most beautiful
carpet.
</p>

<p>
The other two beings that we call understanding
and feelings (sun and moon of the hermetic writings)
look without, instead of seeking the way
within; so it comes to pass that they take the first
best coarse cloths.
</p>

<p>
To bring the most beautiful ring is to bring truth,
which like a ring has neither beginning nor end.
Understanding and feeling go in different directions,
the simpleton waits meekly by the door that leads
to the interior of the great mother. [The appearance
of this conception in the anagogic interpretation
is also important.]
</p>

<p>
In the third test, the search for <q>the fairest
woman,</q> the crown of life, conceived exoterically as
well as esoterically, the carrot represents the vegetative
life (body, the natural man), and the six mice
that draw it are our old friends the six swans or
virtues, and the highest of these compassion&mdash;or
love&mdash;goes as the enthroned queen in the carriage.
The uninitiated man is almost in doubt and asks,
<q>What shall I do with a carrot?</q> Yet the great
mother replies, as it were, <q>Take one of my fundamental
forces.</q> And what do we see then? The
toad becomes a beautiful maiden, etc. The man
<pb n="229"/><anchor id="Pg229"/>
now all at once realizes how fearfully and wonderfully
he is made. Filled with reverence of himself
he is ready to cry, <q>Not my will but thine be done.</q>
</p>

<p>
Still another test remains. We must all go
through a sort of mystical ring, which hangs in the
hall (of learning). Only one in the whole universe
is in a condition to accomplish it, to endure it without
injury. The beautiful delicate maid with the
miraculous gift is the spirit [spiritus or [Symbol: Mercury] of alchemy].
</p>

<p>
We shall add that the two interpretations externally
contradict each other, although each exhibits a
faultless finality. I should note that I have limited
myself to the briefest exposition; in a further working
out of the analysis the two expositions can be
much more closely identified with the motives of the
story.
</p>

<p>
First, then, the question arises, how one and the
same series of images can harmonize several mutually
exclusive interpretations (problem of multiple
interpretation); yet we have discovered in the parable
three practically equivalent schemes of interpretation,
the psychoanalytic, the chemical (scientific),
and the anagogic. Secondly, the question presents
itself more particularly how can two so antithetic
meanings as the psychoanalytic and the anagogic
exist side by side.

<p>
The multiple interpretation of works of fantasy
has become our problem, and the diametrical opposition
of the psychoanalytic and the anagogic interpretation
has particularly struck us. The question
now apparently becomes more complicated if I show
that the psychoanalytic interpretation contains an
analogue that we must take into consideration. The
analogue is presented by the remarkable coexistence
of symbolism of material and functional categories
in the same work of imagination. In order to make
myself intelligible, I must first of all explain what
these categories are.
</p>

<p>
In division 2 of the introductory part we have
seen that the imagination shows a predilection for
symbolic forms of expression, proportionately
greater indeed, the more dreamlike it is. Now by
this symbolism as we observe most clearly in hypnagogic
(half dreaming) hallucinations and in dreams,
three different groups of objects are represented.
</p>

<p>
I. Thought contents, imagination contents, in
brief, the contents or objects of thinking and imagining,
the material of thought whether it be conscious
or unconscious.
</p>

<pb n="234"/><anchor id="Pg234"/>

<p>
II. The condition, activity, structure of the psyche,
the way and manner that it functions and feels, the
method of functioning of the psyche, whether it be
conscious or unconscious.
</p>

<p>
III. Somatic processes (bodily stimulations).
This third sort of objects is closely coördinated with
the other two. It is not capable of interesting us in
the present connection so we pass it by.
</p>

<p>
Therefore we arrive at two categories in which
we can enroll all symbolizing works of the imagination,
the material and the functional.
</p>

<p>
I. The material category is characterized by its
representation of thought contents, i.e., of contents
that are worked out in a train of thoughts (arranged
thought, imagined), whether they are mere images
or groups of images, concepts that are somewhat
drawn out into comparisons and definition processes,
or indeed judgments, trains of reasoning, which serve
as analytic or synthetic operations, etc. Since, as
we know, the phantasies (dreams, reveries, even
poems) are mostly inspired by wishes, it will prove
frequently the case that the contents symbolically
contained in them are wish images, i.e., the imagined
experiencing of gratification.
</p>

<p>
II. The functional category is characterized by
the fact that the condition, structure or capacity for
work of the individual consciousness (or the psychic
apparatus) is itself portrayed. It is termed functional
because it has nothing to do with the material
or the contents of the act of thinking, but applies
merely to manner and method in which consciousness
<pb n="235"/><anchor id="Pg235"/>
functions (rapid, slow, easy, hard, obstructed,
careless, joyful, forced; fruitless, successful; disunited,
split into complexes, united, interchangeable,
troubled, etc.). [It is immaterial whether these are
conscious or unconscious. Thinking must be taken
here in the widest possible sense. It means here all
psychic processes that can have anything as an
<q>object.</q>]
</p>

<p>
Two typical examples will enable us at once
clearly to understand the two categories and keep
them separate.
</p>

<p>
A. Material Symbolism.&mdash;Conditions. In a
drowsy state I reflect upon the nature of the judgments
that are transsubjectively (= for all men)
valid. All at once the thread of the abstract
thought is broken and autosymbolically in the place
of it is presented the following hypnagogic hallucination:
</p>

<p>
Symbol. An enormous circle, or transparent
sphere, floats in the air and men are putting their
heads into this circle.
</p>

<p>
Interpretation. In this symbol everything that I
was thinking of is expressed. The validity of the
transsubjective concerns all men without exception;
the circle goes through all the heads. This validity
must have its cause in something common to all.
The heads all belong to the same apparently homogeneous
sphere. Not all judgments are transsubjective;
with their bodies and limbs men are outside of
and under the sphere and stand on the earth as
separate individuals.
</p>

<pb n="236"/><anchor id="Pg236"/>

<p>
B. Functional Symbolism.&mdash;Conditions. Dreamy
state as above. I reflect upon something or other,
and yet in allowing myself to stray into bypaths of
thought, I am diverted from my peculiar theme.
When I want to get back the autosymbolic phenomenon
appears.
</p>

<p>
Symbol. I am climbing mountains. The nearer
mountains shut out my view of the more distant
ones, from which I have come and to which I should
like to return.
</p>

<p>
Meaning. I have got off the track. I have ventured
too high and the ideas that I have entertained
shut out my starting point like the mountains.
</p>

<p>
To the material category belongs, for example,
the meaning of the strawberry dream explained in
the second part of the introductory chapter. Strawberry
picking is a symbol for an imaged wish gratification
(sexual intercourse), and so for an image
content. The symbolism is therefore a material
one. The greatly preponderating part of psychoanalytic
dream literature is occupied with interpretation
according to material categories.
</p>

<p>
To the functional categories belong, for example,
the symbolism of falling asleep and waking up,
which I have mentioned in the second part in connection
with the interpretation of the parable.
</p>

<p>
The two categories of symbolism, if they never did
anything but parallel each other, would afford us
no analogues for our problem of double meaning.
Now the cases, however, are extremely rare where
<pb n="237"/><anchor id="Pg237"/>
there is only functional or only material symbolism;
the rule is an intimate interweaving of both. To be
sure, one is frequently more emphasized than the
other or more easily accessible, but we can generally
find cases where long contexts of images are susceptible
of material as well as functional interpretation,
alike in detail and continuity of connection.
</p>

<p>
The following may serve as a very simple case in
point. Lying one evening in bed and exhausted and
about to fall asleep, I devoted my thoughts to the
laborious progress of the human spirit in the dim
transcendant province of the mothers-problem.
(Faust, Part II.) More and more sleepy and ever
less able to retain my thoughts, I saw suddenly with
the vividness of an illusion a dream image. I stood
on a lonely stone pier extending far into a dark sea.
The waters of the sea blended at the horizon with
an equally dark-toned mysterious, heavy air. The
overpowering force of this tangible picture aroused
me from my half sleeping state, and I at once recognized
that the image, so nearly an hallucination, was
but a visibly symbolic embodiment of my thought
content that had been allowed to lapse as a result
of my fatigue. The symbol is easily recognized as
such. The extension into the dark sea corresponds
to the pushing on into a dark problem. The blending
of atmosphere and water, the imperceptible
gradation from one to the other means that with
the <q>mothers</q> (as Mephistopheles pictures it) all
times and places are fused, that there we have no
<pb n="238"/><anchor id="Pg238"/>
boundaries between a <q>here</q> and a <q>there,</q> an
<q>above</q> and a <q>below,</q> and for this reason Mephistopheles
can say to Faust on his departure,
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q>Plunge then.&mdash;I could as well say soar.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
We see therefore between the visualized image
and the thought content, which is, as it were, represented
by it, a number of relations. The whole
image resolves itself insofar as it has characteristic
features, almost entirely into such elements as are
most closely related to the thought content. Apart
from these connections of the material category, the
image represents also my momentary psychic condition
(transition to sleep). Whoever is going to
sleep is, as it were, in the mental state of sinking into
a dark sea. (The sinking into water or darkness,
entrance into a forest, etc., are frequently-occurring
threshold symbols.) The clearness of ideas vanishes
there and everything melts together just as did
the water and the atmosphere in the image.
</p>

<p>
This example is but to illustrate; it is in itself
much too slight and simple to make any striking
revelation of the remarkable interlacing of the two
kinds of symbolism. I refer to my studies on symbolism
and on dreams in the bibliography. Exhaustive
treatment at this point would lead us too
far afield. Let us rest satisfied then with the facts
that the psychoanalysts simultaneously deal with two
fundamentally different lines of interpretation in a
product of the phantasy (dream, etc.), quite apart
from the multiple determinants which they can find
<pb n="239"/><anchor id="Pg239"/>
within the material as well as in the functional categories;
both lines of interpretation are supplied by
the same fabric of images, indeed often by the same
elements of this image fabric. This context therefore
must have been sought out artfully enough by
the creative unconscious to answer the double requirement.
</p>

<p>
The coexistence of the material meaning with the
functional is not entirely puzzling to the student of
psychoanalysis. Two facts must be kept in mind
throughout.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, we are acquainted with the principle
of multiple determination or condensation.
The multiplicity of the dimly moving latent dream
thoughts condenses into a few clear dream forms or
symbols, so that one symbol continually, as it were,
appears as the representative of several ideas, and is
therefore interpretable in several ways. That it
should be susceptible of more than one interpretation
can cause no surprise because the fundamental
significance (the latent thoughts) were the very ones
that, by association, caused the selection of the symbols
from an infinite series of possibilities. In the
shaping of the dream, and therefore in the unconscious
dream work, only such pictorial elements
could penetrate into consciousness as satisfied the requirements
of the multiple determination. The
principle of multiple determination is valid not only
within the material and the functional categories,
but makes the fusion of both in the symbol in question
to some extent intelligible. Elements of both
<pb n="240"/><anchor id="Pg240"/>
categories take an active part in the choice of the
symbol. On the one hand, a number of affects press
on towards the symbolic representation of objects to
which they direct themselves (objects of love, hate,
etc.). On the other hand, the psyche takes cognizance
of its own impulses, play of affects, etc., and
this perception will gain representation. Both impulses
take part in the choice of those symbols which
thrust themselves into the nascent consciousness of
phantasy, and so the dream, like the poem, etc., besides
the symbolism of the wish tendencies (material
categories) that animate them, bears the stamp of
the psychic authorship (functional category) of the
dreamer or the author. [Ferenczi defends the view
for the myth also that the material symbolism must
coincide with the functional (Imago I, p. 283).]
</p>

<p>
Secondly, it has been shown in recent times in
psychoanalytic studies that symbols which were originally
material pass over to functional use. If we
thoroughly analyze for a sufficient time the dreams
of a person we shall find that certain symbols which
at first probably appeared only incidentally to signify
some idea content, wish content, etc., return and
become a persistent or typical form. And the more
such a typical form is established and is impressed,
the farther it is removed from its first ephemeral
meaning, and the more it becomes a symbolic representative
of a whole group of similar experiences, a
spiritual capital, so to speak, till finally we can regard
it simply as the representative of a spiritual
current (love, hate, tendency to frivolity, to cruelty,
<pb n="241"/><anchor id="Pg241"/>
to anxiety, etc.). What has been accomplished
there is a transition from the material to the functional
on the path of a determination inward or intro-determination
(verinnerlichung) as I shall call
it. Later I shall have more to say about intro-determination.
For the present this may suffice for
the understanding, that the material and the functional
symbolism, in spite of their at first apparently
fundamental difference, are essentially related in
some way, which is illuminated by the process of
intro-determination.
</p>

<p>
The analogue of the problem of multiple interpretation
unfolded in the preceding section is shown
to be a question that can be easily answered. And
we would bring our problem to a generally satisfactory
position if we succeeded in showing that the anagogic
interpretation, whose alignment with the psychoanalytic
seemed so impracticable, is a form of
functional interpretation, or at least related to it.
In this case it would be at once comprehensible how
a product of the imagination harmonizes with several
expositions (problem of multiple interpretation);
because this variety of sense had already operated
in the selection of the symbol and indeed, in
those cases as well where we did not at first sight
suspect the coöperation of the anagogic thoughts;
secondly, the anagogic and the psychoanalytic interpretations
are somehow reconciled to each other,
whereby possibly also the position of the natural
science interpretation can be made somewhat clearer.
</p>

<p>
The possibility that the anagogic has some part
<pb n="242"/><anchor id="Pg242"/>
in the creation of the functional, will be brought
nearer by the fact that our previously offered anagogic
expositions (fairy tales, parabola) markedly
resemble functional interpretations. In the tale of
the six swans Hitchcock explains the reception of
the maiden into the castle as the reception of sin into
the heart; the seven children are the seven virtues
(consequently spiritual tendencies). The small
maiden is conscience, the tissues are processes of
thought. In the story of the three feathers, again,
one son is conscience; the secret door is the entrance
to the inner life, to spiritual absorption, the three
feathers are spiritual tendencies, etc. In the dream
of the <q>flying post</q> conscience appears as the conductor.
The <q>Mills of God,</q> which psychologically
also represents conscience, the more strikingly
because the burden of sin, guilty feeling, drives them,
also appear in the parable. The lion or the dragon
which must be overcome on the mystic path is again
a spiritual force. The approximation to the functional
category is not to be denied. Processes that
show an interplay of spiritual powers are symbolically
represented there. But we are at once struck
with a difference. The true functional phenomenon,
as I have so far described it, pictures the actual
psychic state or process; the anagogic image appears
on the contrary to point to a state or process that
is to be experienced in the future. We shall pass
over for a time the last topic, which will not, however,
be forgotten, and turn to the question as to
the point on which the anagogic and the functional
<pb n="243"/><anchor id="Pg243"/>
interpretations can best be brought together. This
point appears to me to be introversion, first because
it is related to the previously mentioned intro-determination,
and second, because it is familiar to psychoanalysis
and is of great importance in anagogic
method.
</p>

<p>
The term <q>introversion</q> comes from C. G. Jung.
It means sinking into one's own soul; the withdrawal
of interest from the outer world; the seeking for joys
that can be afforded by the inner world. The psychology
of the neuroses has led to the concept of
introversion, a province, therefore, which principally
treats of morbid forms and functions of introversion.
The sinking of oneself into one's own soul
also appears exactly as a morbid losing of oneself
in it. We can speak of introversion neuroses.
Jung regards dementia precox as an introversion
neurosis. Freud, who has adopted the concept of
introversion [with some restrictions] regards the
introversion of the libido as a regular and necessary
precondition of every psychoneurosis. Jung
(Jb. ps. F., III, p. 159) speaks of <q>certain mental
disturbances [he means dementia precox] which are
induced by the fact that the patients retire more and
more from reality, sink into their phantasy, whereby
in proportion as reality loses its force, the inner
world takes on a reality and determining power.</q>
We may also define introversion as a resignation of
the joys of the outer world (probably unattainable
or become troubled) and a seeking for the libido
sources in one's own ego. So we see how generally
<pb n="244"/><anchor id="Pg244"/>
self-chastisement, introversion and autoerotism
are connected.
</p>

<p>
The turning away from the outer world and turning
in to the inner, is required by all those methods
which lead to intensive exercise of religion and a
mystic life. The experts in mysteries provide for
opportunities that should encourage introversion.
Cloisters and churches are institutions of introversion.
The symbolism of religious doctrine and rite
is full of images of introversion, which is, in short,
one of the most important presuppositions of mysticism.
</p>

<p>
Religious and mythical symbolism has countless
images for introversion; e.g., dying, going down,
subterranean crypts, vaults, dark temples, into the
underworld, hell, the sea, etc.; being swallowed by
a monster or a fish (as Jonah), stay in the wilderness,
etc. The symbols for introversion correspond
in large part with those that I have described for
going to sleep and waking (threshold symbolism), a
fact that can be readily appreciated from their actual
similarity. The descent of Faust to the mothers is
an introversion symbol. Introversion fulfills here
clearly the aim of bringing to reality, i.e., to psychological
reality, something that is attainable only by
phantasy (world of the past, Helen).
</p>

<p>
In Jacob Boehme (De Vita Mentali) the disciple
says to the master, <q>How may I attain suprasensuous
life, so that I may see God and hear him speak?</q>
The master says, <q>When you can lift yourself for
one moment into that realm where no creature dwelleth,
<pb n="245"/><anchor id="Pg245"/>
you will hear what God speaks.</q> The disciple
says, <q>Is that near or far?</q> The master says,
<q>It is in yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
The hermetics often urge retirement, prayer and
meditation, as prerequisites for the work; it is
treated of still more in the hieroglyphic pictures
themselves. The picture of death is already familiar
to us from the hermetic writings, but in the technical
language there are still other expressions for
introversion, e.g., the shutting up in the receptacle,
the solution in the mercury of the sages, the return
of the substance to its radical condition (by means
of the "radical" or root dampness).
</p>

<p>
Similar features in our parable are the wandering
in the dense forest, the stay in the lion's den, the
going through the dark passage into the garden, the
being shut up in the prison or, in the language of
alchemy, the receptacle.
</p>

<p>
Introversion is continually connected with regression.
Regression, as may be recalled from the 2d
section of Part I, is a harking back to more primitive
psychic activities, from thinking to gazing, from
doing to hallucinating; a striving back towards childhood
and the pleasures of childhood. Introversion
accordingly is accompanied by a desire for symbolic
form of expression (the mystical education is carried
on in symbols), and causes the infantile imagos
to revive&mdash;chiefly the mother image. It was pre-eminently
father and mother who appeared as objects
of childish love, as well as of defiance. They
are unique and imperishable, and in the life of adults
<pb n="246"/><anchor id="Pg246"/>
there is no difficulty in reawakening and making
active those memories and those imagos. We easily
comprehend the fact that the symbolic aim of the
previously mentioned katabasis always has a maternal
character; earth, hole, sea, belly of fish, etc.,
that all are symbols for mother and womb. Regression
revives the Œdipus complex with its
thoughts of incest, etc. Regression leads back to all
these relics now done away with in life and repressed.
It actually leads into a sort of underworld, into the
world of titanic wishes, as I have called them. How
far this was the case in the alchemistic parable, I
have fully shown in the psychoanalytic treatment of
it. Here I need merely to refer to the maternal nature
of the symbols cited: receptacle, mercury of the
sages (<q>mother of metals</q>) and radical moisture,
also called <q>milk</q> and the like.
</p>

<p>
Fairy tales have frequently a very pretty functional
symbolism for the way in which introversion
leads to the mother imago. Thus the simpleton in
the fairy tale of the feathers comes through the
gate of introversion exactly into the family circle, to
the mother that cares for him. There his love finds
its satisfaction. There he even gets a daughter,
replica of the mother imago, for a wife.
</p>

<p>
In the parable the wandering in the forest (introversion)
is followed by the battle (suggestive of
incest) with the lion (father or mother in their awe
inspiring form); the inclusion in the receptacle (introversion)
by the accomplishment of the incest.
</p>

<p>
If it is now clear also that in introversion, as a
<pb n="247"/><anchor id="Pg247"/>
result of the regression that is connected with it,
visions of <q>titanic</q> emotions (incest, separating
of parents, etc.) are encountered, yet it has not become
in the slightest degree comprehensible how
these visions are related to the treatment of anagogic
ideas. And that is indeed the question.
</p>

<p>
We can really understand these striking facts better
if we recall what I have said above about the
type formation and the intro-determination of the
symbols, namely, that symbols can depart from their
original narrower meaning and become types for
an entire class of experiences whereby an advance is
made from the material to the functional meaning.
Some examples will elucidate this.
</p>

<p>
I have observed particularly fine cases of intro-determination
in a series of experiments in basin
divination (lecanomancy) which I have carried on
for several years. Lecanomancy resembles crystal
gazing, except that the gazer looks into a basin of
water. In the visions of my subject, Lea, typical
forms were pictured, which always recurred. Regarded
as symbols they were, as subsequent analysis
showed, almost all subjected to inward accentuation
or intro-determination. Thus, for instance, a black
cat appeared. At first it appeared as representative
of Lea's grandmother, who was cat-like, malicious
and fawning. Later the cat stood for the corresponding
traits that she perceived in herself. Above
all the cat is the symbol of her grandmother, so the
grandmother (or cat) is a mental current of Lea.
Frequently there appears in the image a Dyas, sometimes
<pb n="248"/><anchor id="Pg248"/>
in the shape of a two-headed snake, of two
hands, of two feet, or of a woman with two faces,
etc. Above all, every antithesis appears to have
some external meaning, two men who love each
other, etc. So it becomes clear that the common
element which finds its most pregnant expression in
the double faced woman is the Dyas in itself and that
it means bisexuality, psychic hermaphroditism.
More than that it is definitely certain that the deepest
sense of the symbol means a complete dissociation of
Lea's character into two different personalities, one
of which may be called the savage and the other the
mild. (Lea herself uses the expressions cynical and
ideal personality.) In one of the later experiments
Lea saw her cynic double vividly personified and
spoke in this character, which is closely related to
the <q>black cat.</q> The Dyas in the symbols has the
value first of a representation of externals (two
lovers, etc.), then as symbols of bisexuality. The
sexual Dyas can again be conceived as a symbol or
characteristic of a still more general and comprehensive
dissociation of the ego. A further symbol
and one still more tending towards intro-determination
was death. Starting from connections with
definite external experiences and ideas of actual
death, the meaning of the symbol became more and
more spiritual, till it reached the meaning of the
fading away of psychic impulses. What died symbolically
or had to die was represented by an old
man who sacrificed himself after suffering all kinds
of fortune. The dying of this old man signified, as
<pb n="249"/><anchor id="Pg249"/>
analysis showed, the same thing that we call the
<q>putting off the old Adam</q> (turning over a new
leaf). The figure of the old man, originally Lea's
grandfather, then her father, came to have this meaning
only after a long process of intro-determination.
</p>

<p>
A few more examples for typical figures.
</p>

<p>
In many dreams of a woman analyzed by me
(Pauline, in my treatise Zur Symbolbildung), a cow
appears as a typical image. The alternation of this
cow with more or less definite mother symbols leads
to identification of the cow with the mother. Two
circumstantial dreams that were fully analyzed
showed, however, that the cow and other forms with
which she alternated cannot be translated so correctly
by the concept of mother as by that of the
maternal authority and finally still more correctly by
self-criticism or conscience, of which maternal authority
is but a type. Children figure in Pauline's
case as a result of various experiences, as typical of
obstacles.
</p>

<p>
In the case of another dreamer the father stands
in similar relation as the determinant that paralyzes
his resolutions.
</p>

<p>
The climbing of an ascent, usually a symbol of
coitus (hurrying upward which makes us out of
breath), turns out often in a deeper relation as the
effort to get from the disagreeable things of life to
a place of retreat (lonely attics, etc.), inaccessible
to other persons (= thoughts); and now we see
that this deeper meaning appears without prejudice
to the first, for even coitus, like all transport, is only
<pb n="250"/><anchor id="Pg250"/>
a special case of flight from the outer life, one of the
forms of spiritual oblivion. Hence in part the
mythologically and psychopathologically important
comparison of intoxication, intoxicating drink and
sperm, soma and semen. Ascent = coitus is in this
case a type for a quite comprehensive class of experience.
</p>

<p>
Marcinowski found in his analyses that the father
in dream life often was a <q>symbol of an outlived,
obsolete attitude.</q> (Z. Bl. f. Ps., II, 9.)
</p>

<p>
Other examples of types are the phallus, the sun
and other religiously revered objects, if we regard
them as does Jung (Wandl. u. Sym., Jb. ps. F., III-IV)
as a symbol of the libido. [The concept of
which is extended by Jung almost to Schopenhauer's
Will.] The typical character of divine personalities
is moreover quite clearly emphasized by Jung
himself.
</p>

<p>
The snake, about whose significance as a <q>negative
phallus,</q> etc. [developed in detail by Jung], we
shall have more to say, can also be regarded as a
typical image. Bull, cow and other animal forms
are in mythology as in dreams typical transmutations,
with unlimited possibility of intro-determination.
Dogs are often in dreams the representations of animal
propensities. The beast is often <q>la bête
humaine</q> in the dreamer's own inner life. We
have become acquainted with the terrible lions, the
bears, etc., as father types; here we get a new perspective
which makes clear the one-sidedness of our
first conception.
</p>

<pb n="251"/><anchor id="Pg251"/>

<p>
Since psychoanalysis has found acceptation, many
of its followers believe they are able to solve, with
their work of analysis alone, all the psychological,
esthetic and mythological problems that come up.
We understand only half of the psychic impulses, as
indeed we do all spiritual development, if we look
merely at the root. We have to regard not merely
whence we come but also whither we go. Then only
can the course of the psyche be comprehended, ontogenetically
as well as phylogenetically, according
to a dynamic scheme as it were.
</p>

<p>
If we apply this fundamental principle to symbolism
there develops therefrom the obligation to
keep both visible poles in view, between which the
advance of significance, the process of intro-determination
is completed. (An externalization is also
possible, yet the internalization or intro-determination
must be regarded as the normal process.) [It
corresponds namely to the process of education and
progress of culture. This will soon be cleared up.]
To the most general type belong then, without doubt,
those symbols or frequently disguised images, concerning
which we wondered before, that besides representing
<q>titanic</q> tendencies, they are fitted to
represent the anagogic. The solution of the riddle
is found the instant we regard these images as types
with a certain degree of intro-determination, as
types for a few fundamental forces of the soul, with
which we are all endowed, and whose typical symbols
are for that reason of general applicability. [I
will therefore call these types the human elementary
<pb n="252"/><anchor id="Pg252"/>
types.] For example, if by psychoanalysis we deduce
father and mother, etc., from some of the symbols
appearing in dreams, we have in these representations
of the psychic images, as the psychoanalyst
calls them, in reality derived mere types whose meaning
will change according to the ways of viewing
them, somewhat as the color of many minerals
changes according to the angle at which we hold them
to the light. The actual father or mother, the experiences
that surrounded them, were the material
used in the formation of the types; they were external
things even if important, while later the
father, etc., emerging as symbol, may have significance
as a type of the spiritual power of the very
person in question; a spiritual power to be sure,
which the person in question feels to be like a father
for otherwise the father figure would not be suited
for the symbol. And we can go so far as to call
this spiritual power a father image. That should
not however, mislead us into taking that real person,
who in the individual case generally (though not
always) has furnished the type, for the real or the
most essential. The innermost lies in ourselves and
is only fashioned and exercised upon persons of the
external world.
</p>

<p>
So then we get for the typical symbol a double
perspective. The types are given, we can look
through them forward and backward. In both cases
there will be distortions of the image; we shall frequently
see projected upon each other, things that
do not belong together, we shall perceive convergences
<pb n="253"/><anchor id="Pg253"/>
at vanishing points which are to be ascribed
only to perspective. I might for brevity's sake call
the errors so resulting errors of superposition. The
significance of this concept will, I hope, come to have
still greater validity in psychoanalysis. [This error
of superposition C. G. Jung attempts to unmask,
when he writes: <q>As libido has a forward tendency,
so in a way, incest is that which tends backward
into childhood. It is not incest for the child,
and only for the adult, who possesses a well constituted
sexuality, does this regressive tendency become
incest in that he is no longer a child, but has
a sexuality that really no longer can suffer a regressive
application.</q> (Jung, Psychology of the Unconscious.)
It may moreover be remarked that
Freud also is careful not to take the incest disclosed
by psychoanalysis in too physical a sense.] This
error of superposition is found not only in the view
backward but in the forward view. So what I, as
interpreter of mystical symbolism, may say about the
possible development of the soul will be affected
by this error of superposition. It is not in my
power to correct it. In spite of everything, the
treatment of symbolism from the two points of view
must be superior to the onesided treatment; in order
to approximate a fundamental comprehension, which
to be sure remains an ideal, the different aspects
must be combined and in order to make this clear
I have added a synthetic treatment to the analytic
part of my work.
</p>

<p>
Looking back through the elementary types, we
<pb n="254"/><anchor id="Pg254"/>
see the infantile images together with those non-moral
origins that psychoanalysis discovers in us;
looking forward we notice thoughts directed to certain
goals that will be mentioned later. The elementary
types themselves thanks to intro-determination
represent however a collection of our spiritual
powers, which we have first formed and exercised
at the time that the images arose, and which are in
their nature closely related to these images, indeed
completely united with them as a result of the errors
of superposition&mdash;this collection of powers, I say,
accompanies us through our entire life and is that
from which are taken the powers that will be required
for future development. The objects or applications
change, the powers remain almost the
same. The symbolism of the material categories
which depends on external things changes with them;
but the symbolism of the functional categories, which
reflects these powers remains constant. The types
with their intro-determination belong to the functional
categories; and so they picture the constant
characters.
</p>

<p>
That experience to which the suggestions of symbolism
(brought to verbal expression by means of
introversion) point as to a possible spiritual development,
corresponds to a religious ideal; when intensively
lived out this development is called mysticism.
[We can define mysticism as that religious
state which struggles by the shortest way towards
the accomplishment of the end of religion, the union
with the divinity; or as an intensive cultivation of
<pb n="255"/><anchor id="Pg255"/>
oneself in order to experience this union.] It presents
itself if instead of looking backward we gaze
forward from our elementary types to the beyond.
But let us not forget that we can regard mysticism
only as the most extreme, and therefore psychically
the most internal, unfolding of the religious life,
as the ideal which is hardly to be attained, although
I consider that much is possible in this direction.
If my later examination carries us right into the
heart of mysticism, without making the standpoint
clear every time, we now know what restrictions we
must be prepared for.
</p>

<p>
If I take the view that those powers, whose images
(generally veiled in symbolism) are the elementary
types, do not change, I do not intend to imply that
it is not possible to sublimate them. With the increasing
education of man they support a sublimation
of the human race which yet shows in recognizable
form the fundamental nature of the powers. One
of the most important types, in which this transformation
process is consummated and which refines
the impulse and yet allows some of its character to
remain, is the type mother, i.e., incest. Among religious
symbols we find countless incest images but
that the narrow concept of incest is no longer suited
to their psychological basis (revealed through analysis)
has been, among psychoanalysts, quite clearly
recognized by Jung. Therefore in the case of every
symbolism tending to ethical development, the anagogic
point of view must be considered, and most
of all in religious symbolism. The impulse corresponding
<pb n="256"/><anchor id="Pg256"/>
to the religious incest symbols is preeminently
to be conceived in the trend toward introversion
and rebirth which will be treated of later.
[Vid. <ref target="Note_C">note C</ref>, at the end of the volume.]
</p>

<p>
I have just used the expression <q>sublimation.</q>
This Freudian term and concept is found in an exactly
similar significance in the hermetic writers.
In the receptacle where the mystical work of education
is performed, i.e., in man, substances are sublimated;
in psychological terms this means that impulses
are to be refined and brought from their
baseness to a higher level. Freud makes it clear
that the libido, particularly the unsocial sexual libido,
is in favorable circumstances sublimated, i.e., changed
into a socially available impelling power. This happens
in the evolution of the human race and is recapitulated
in the education of the individual.
</p>

<p>
I take it for granted that the fundamental character
of the elementary psychic powers in which the
sublimation is consummated is the more recognizable
the less the process of sublimation is extended in
time. In mysticism, e.g., the fundamental character
penetrates the primal motive because the latter
wishes to lead the relatively slightly sublimated impulses
by a shortened process to the farthest goal
of sublimation. Mysticism undertakes to accomplish
in individuals a work that otherwise would
take many generations. What I said therefore
about the unchangeability of the fundamental powers
or their primal motive, is wholly true of its fate
in mystical development.
</p>

<pb n="257"/><anchor id="Pg257"/>

<p>
The Mohammedan mystic Arabi (1165-1240)
writes, <q>Love as such, in its individual life, is the
same for sensuous and spiritual, therefore equally
for every Arab (of an allegory) and for me, but
the objects of love are different. They loved
sensible phenomena while I, the mystic, love the
most intimate existence.</q> (Horten, Myst. Texte, p.
12.)
</p>

<p>
The religious-mystical applications of the fundamental
powers represented by the types, in the sense
of a sublimation, does not manifest therefore in
contrast to their retrospective form (titanic, purposeless
form) an essentially foreign nature; the
important novelty in them is that they no longer
are used egotistically but have acquired a content
that is ethically valuable, to which the intro-determination
was an aid. This determination, whose
external aspects we have noticed in the types or symbols,
is only the visible expression of a far more
important actual intro-determination whose accomplishment
lies in an amplification of personality, and
will later be considered in detail.
</p>

<p>
In the psychoanalytic consideration of the alchemistic
parable it would appear that only the titanic
impulses were realized there, e.g., to have the mother
as a lover and to kill the father. Now it corresponds
to a really significant intro-determination
when we hear that in the alchemistic work the father
is the same as the son, and when we understand
that the father is a state, or psychic potentiality, of
the <q>son,</q> whom the latter in himself, has to conquer,
<pb n="258"/><anchor id="Pg258"/>
exactly in the same manner as Lea in the lecomantic
study strove to put off the old man.
</p>

<p>
The alchemist Rulandus (Lex., p. 24) quotes the
<q>Turba</q>: <q>Take the white tree, build him a
round, dark, dew-encircled house, and set in it a
hundred year-old man and close it so that no wind
or dust can get to him (introversion); then leave
him there eight days. I tell you that that man will
not cease to eat of the fruit of that tree till he becomes
a youth. O what a wonderful nature, for
here is the father become son and born again.</q>
Ibid: <q>The stone [that is in the anagogic sense,
man] is at first the senex, afterwards young, so it is
said filius interficit patrem; the father must die, the
son be born, die with each other and be renewed
with each other.</q>
</p>

<p>
We must proceed similarly if we wish to interpret
the parable anagogically.
</p>

<p>
What I have already taken from the anagogic
fairy tale interpretation as a symbol of introversion
shows, of course, also the character of intro-determination.
</p>

<p>
As for the nature of the relatively unchangeable
spiritual tendencies represented by the elementary
types [That can also be called in mythological study
primal motives] a simple examination of the essentials
without any psychological hair splitting, brings
us at once to an elementary scheme that will help
us to understand the changes (intro-determination)
that take place in accordance with the elementary
types. We need here only to examine the simplest
<pb n="259"/><anchor id="Pg259"/>
reactions of the individual, necessarily produced by
rubbing up again the external world; reactions which
become persistent forms of experience that are approximately
as self-evident as the libido itself. The
degree of egoism which is active in the elementary
tendencies must, according to the experience of psychoanalysis,
be considered very great. For this purpose
I have selected in what follows an excessively
egotistical expression for the <q>titanic</q> aspect, the
retrospective form, of the tendencies; and this same
excessive expression which would seem to be rather
objectionable when applied to the basis of a religious
development, enables us, thanks to the principle of
intro-determination, to understand this development.
</p>

<p>
Starting from the libido in the most general sense
we arrive first of all at the two phenomena, the
agreeableness and the disagreeableness, from which
results at once, acceptance and aversion. Obstacles
may aggravate both activities, so that acceptance
becomes robbery and aversion becomes annihilation.
These possibilities can to be sure only become acts
in so far as they prove practically feasible. In all
cases they are present in the psyche, and in this crude
primal form play no small part in the soul of the
child. It is indeed only a blind sentimentality that
can raise the child to an angelic status, from which
it is as far removed as from its opposite. We
should be careful not to regard the crude form of the
impulse as crude in the sense of an educated humanity,
which must see in the crudeness something morally
inferior. In robbery and annihilation there
<pb n="260"/><anchor id="Pg260"/>
exists on the primitive or childish level hardly the
slightest germ of badness. There is much to be
said about the psychology and morality of the child.
I cannot, however, enter very deeply into this broad
topic, interesting though it is.
</p>

<p>
The primal tendencies, when directed toward the
persons in the environment, produce certain typical
phenomena. I can unfortunately describe them
only with expressions which, if the cultured man
uses them, evoke the idea of crime. An ethically
colorless language should be made available for
these things. [The dream and the myth have found
for them the language of symbolism.] The opposition
of a fellow man against the working out
of an impulse arouses a tendency to overcome this
man, to get him out of the way, to kill him. The
type of the obstructing man is always the instructor
(father, eventually mother). That he is at the
same time a doer of good is less appreciated because
the psychical apparatus takes the satisfaction of desires
as the natural thing, which does not excite its
energy nearly as much as does a hindrance to its satisfaction.
[Recognition of a good deed, thankfulness,
etc., regularly presuppose sublimation; they do
not belong to the titanic aspect. A form of appreciation
of this kindness however comes to mind. Towards
the mother there occurs on the part of the
child, though it has been completely overlooked for
a long time, very early and gradually increasing, a
sexually-toned feeling, although the manifestations
of this feeling are very dim and at times may completely
<pb n="261"/><anchor id="Pg261"/>
disappear. In this <q>love</q> is contained a
germ of desire, of erotic appropriation-to-self. Any
woman in the environment and especially the mother
must needs supply the ideal of the desired woman.
In so far as the father is perceived as an obstacle
to the love towards the mother he must, in the
elementary tendency, be killed to remove the obstacle,
and there arises the murder impulse belonging
to the Œdipus Complex. [The child has no clear
idea of death. It is only a matter of wishing to
have some one out of the way. If this primal motive
appears to us subsequently as a <q>killing,</q> it is
again only because of the error of superposition, just
as in the later mentioned <q>rape.</q>] In so far
as the mother herself does not meet the desired
tenderness or in refusing, acts as a corrective agent,
while carrying on the education, she, too, becomes
an obstacle, a personality contrasting with the
<q>dear</q> mother, a contrast which plunges the psyche
in anxiety and bitterness. Anxiety comes principally
from the conflict of psychical tendencies, which result
from the same person being both loved and
hated. The correlative to the denying action of
the mother is to commit rape on her. Another cause
of the attraction towards the mother besides the
erotically toned one, is the desire for her care, called
forth by the hardships encountered elsewhere in the
world. It is an indolence opposed to the duties of
life. The propensity towards ease is psychologically
a very important factor. The home is in general
the place of protection; the characteristic embodiment
<pb n="262"/><anchor id="Pg262"/>
of this is preëminently the mother. We speak
of maternal solicitude but less of paternal solicitude.
I have noted the solicitous mother type in the story
of the three feathers, where the mother toad bestows
the gifts from the big box. In so far as the
solicitous person refuses the requests made of her
and for reasons of necessity thrusts the child out
into the world, or in so far as any other obstacles
(demands of life) stand in the way of the gratification
of the lazy, <q>feed me</q> state of mind, like
the angel with the flaming sword before the entrance
to paradise, so far the obstructing power appears
as the type of the <q>terrible</q> mother, a picture
whose terribleness is yet intensified by the working
of the incest conflict. In this aspect therefore the
otherwise beloved mother is a hostile personality.
</p>

<p>
To the process of education on the part of the
parents, felt as pedantry by the child, or to otherwise
misunderstood action, he opposes a well known
defiance, and there results, as also from the attempt
to change in general the rough path of life, the
hopeful attempt to get a creative <q>improvement,</q>
which I have already discussed. The wish to die
sometimes occurs. Further the obstacles that stand
in the way of the full erotic life in the external
world, in so far as they are insuperable or are not
overcome on account of laziness, lead to autoerotism.
(That this is found even in early childhood
is for the mechanism of the impulses, a side-issue.
The scheme just given is not to be regarded
as a historical or chronological development, but
<pb n="263"/><anchor id="Pg263"/>
the tendencies are quite as intimately connected with
each other as with the acquisition of the psychical
restraints that are not generally brought to view;
in separating them we commit something like an
error.)
</p>

<p>
We have considered the following main forces:
1. Removal of obstacles. 2. Desire for the solicitude
of the parents. 3. Desire for the pleasurable
[especially of the woman]. 4. Auto-erotism.
5-6. Improvement and re-creation. 7. Death
wish. The following scheme shows the retrograde
(titanic) as well as the anagogic aspect of these
powers, which later corresponds to an intro-determination
of the types, and a species of sublimation
of impulses.

We need not scent anything extraordinary behind
these intro-determinations, as the scheme is here
indeed only roughly sketched; they take place in
each and every one of us, otherwise we should be
mere beasts. Only they do not in every one of us
rise to the intensity of the mystical life.
</p>

<pb n="264"/><anchor id="Pg264"/>

<p>
A more careful inquiry into the mechanism of
the psychic powers in the development of mysticism,
would show in greater detail how everything that
happens is utilized toward intro-determination in the
process of education. It would be interesting as an
example to discover the application of the special
senses to introversion and ascertain the fate of the
sense qualities. It is quite remarkable what a
prominent rôle tastes and smells often play in descriptions
given by persons who have followed the
path of mysticism. I mention the odor of sanctity
and its opposite in the devilish, evil odor. The experimenter
in magic Staudenmaier, who will be mentioned
later, has established in his own case the
coördination of his partial souls (personifications,
autonomous complexes) to definite bodily functions
and to definite organs. Certain evil, partial souls,
which appear to him in hallucinations as diabolical
goat faces, were connected with the function of
certain parts of the lower intestine.
</p>

<p>
Mysticism stimulates a much more powerful sublimation
of impulses than the conventional education
of men. So it is not strange if intro-determination
does not accomplish its desires quickly but remains
fragmentary. In such unfortunate or fragmentary
cases, the inward-determined powers show
more than mere traces of their less refined past.
The heroes of such miscarried mysticism appear as
rather extraordinary saints. So, for instance, Count
von Zinzendorf's warm love of the Savior has so
much of the sensual flavor, with furthermore such
<pb n="265"/><anchor id="Pg265"/>
decided perversities, that the outpourings of his
rapture are positively laughable. Thus the pious
man indulges his phantasy with a marked predilection
for voluptuousness in the <q>Seitenhölchen</q>
(Wound in the Side) in Jesus' body and with an
unmistakable identification of this <q>cleft</q> with the
vulva.

<p>
Returning to the previously mentioned <q>spiritual
powers</q> I should mention that alchemy also attempts
to include in a short schema the inventory of
powers available for the Great Work. It uses different
symbols for this purpose; one of the most frequent
is the seven metals or planets. Whether I say
with the astrologers that the soul (not the celestial
spirit, which is derived from God) flowing in from
the seven planets upon man, is therefore composed
of their seven influences, or if with the alchemists I
speak of the seven metals, which come together in
the microcosm, it is of course quite the same, but
expressed in another closely related symbol. The
metals are, as we know, incomplete and have to be
<pb n="267"/><anchor id="Pg267"/>
<q>improved</q> or <q>made complete.</q> That means
we must sublimate our impulses.
</p>

<p>
<q>From the highest to the lowest everything rises
by intermediate steps on the infinite ladder, in such
manner that those pictures and images, as outgrowths
of the divine mind, through subordinate divinities
and demigods impart their gifts and emanations to
men. The highest of these are: Spirit of inquiry,
power of ruling and mastering self, a brave heart,
clearness of perception, ardent affection, acuteness
in the art of exposition, and fruitful creative power.
The efficient forces of all these God has above all
and originally in himself. From him they have
received the seven spirits and divinities, which move
and rule the seven planets, and are called angels,
so that each has received his own, distinct from the
rest. They share them again among the seven
orders of demons subordinated to them, one under
each. And these finally transmit them to men.</q>
(Adamah Booz. Sieb. Grunds., p. 9 ff.)
</p>

<p>
In this enumeration the fundamental powers,
whose partition varies exceedingly, already show a
certain measure of intro-determination. If we wish
to contrast their titanic with their anagogic aspect,
we get approximately the following scheme, to which
I add the familiar astrological characters of the
seven planets.

<p>
[Freud is of the opinion that the original inquisitiveness
about the sexual secret is abnormally transformed
into morbid over subtlety; and yet can still
furnish an impulsive power for legitimate thirst for
knowledge.]
</p>

<p>
Beside the partition of the fundamental powers
according to the favorite number seven, there are
to be sure in alchemy still other schemata with other
symbols. We must furthermore continually keep in
mind that the symbols in alchemy are used in many
senses.
</p>

<p>
In so far as the Constellations, as is often to be
understood in the hermetic art, are fundamental
psychic powers, it sounds just like psychoanalysis
when Paracelsus expresses the view that in sleep
the <q>sidereal</q> body is in unobstructed operation,
soars up to its fathers and has converse with the
stars.
</p>

<p>
With regard to intro-determination I must refer
to my observations in the following sections on the
extension of personality. It is an important fact
that those external obstructions which oppose the
unrestrained unfolding of the titanic impulses are
gradually taken up as constraints into the psyche,
which adopts those external laws, that would make
life practicable. In so far as deep conflicts do not
hinder it, there arises by the operation of these
laws a corresponding influence upon the propensities.
<pb n="269"/><anchor id="Pg269"/>
Habit, however, can learn to carry a heavy yoke
with love, even to make it the condition of life. I
have just made the restriction: if conflicts do not
hinder it; now usually these exist, even for the mystics;
and the <q>Work</q> is above all directed toward
their overcoming. For the annihilation of the opposition,
the weapons aimed outward in the <q>titanic</q>
phase must be turned inward; there and not outside
of us is the conflict. [Here we see the actual intro-determination
briefly mentioned above.]

<head>B. Effects Of Introversion.</head>

<p>
Introversion is no child's play. It leads to
abysses, by which we may be swallowed up past recall.
Whoever submits to introversion arrives at
a point where two ways part; and there he must
come to a decision, than which a more difficult one
cannot be conceived. The symbol of the abyss, of
the parting of the ways, both were clearly contained
in our parable. The occurrence of the similar
motive in myths and fairy tales is familiar. The
danger is obvious in that the hero generally makes
an apparently quite trivial mistake and then must
make extraordinary efforts to save himself from the
effects of these few trivial errors. One more wrong
step and all would have been lost.
</p>

<p>
Introversion accordingly presents two possibilities,
either to gain what the mystic work seeks, or to
lose oneself.
</p>

<p>
In introversion the libido sinks into <q>its own
depths</q> (a figure that Nietzsche likes to use), and
<pb n="270"/><anchor id="Pg270"/>
finds there below in the shadows of the unconscious,
the equivalent for the world above which it has
left, namely the world of phantasy and memories,
of which the strongest and most influential are the
early infantile memory images. It is the child's
world, the paradise of early childhood, from which
a rigorous law has separated us. In this subterranean
realm slumber sweet domestic feelings and
the infinite hopes of all <q>becoming.</q> Yet as Mephistopheles
says, <q>The peril is great.</q> This depth
is seducing: it is the <q>mother</q> and&mdash;death. If
the libido remains suspended in the wonder realm of
the inner world the man has become but a shadow for
the world above. He is as good as dead or mortally
ill; if the libido succeeds however in tearing itself
loose again and of pressing on to the world above,
then a miracle is revealed; this subterranean journey
has become a fountain of youth for it, and from its
apparent death there arises a new productiveness.
This train of thought is very beautifully contained
in an Indian myth: Once on a time Vishnu absorbed
in rapture (introversion) bore in this sleep
Brahma, who enthroned on a lotus flower, arose
from Vishnu's navel and was carrying the Vedas,
eagerly reading them. (Birth of creative thought
from introversion.) Because of Vishnu's rapture,
however, a monstrous flood overcame the world
(swallowing up through introversion, symbolizing
the danger of entering into the mother of death).
A demon profiting by the danger, stole the vedas
from Brahma and hid them in the deep. (Swallowing
<pb n="271"/><anchor id="Pg271"/>
of the libido.) Brahma wakes Vishnu and he,
changing into a fish, dived into the flood, battled
with the demon (dragon fight), conquered him and
brought the vedas up again. (Prize attained with
difficulty.) (Cf. Jung, Psychology of the Unconscious.)
</p>

<p>
The marvel of the invigoration that can be attained
in the successful issue of introversion is comparable
to the effect that Antæus felt on touching his
mother, the earth. The mother of men, to whom
introversion carries us, is the spirit of the race, and
from it flows gigantic strength. <q>This occasional
retiring into oneself, which means a return to an
infantile relation to the parent images, appears
within certain limits to have a favorable effect upon
the condition of the individual.</q> Of this mine of
power Stekel (Nerv. Angst., p. 375) writes:
<q>When mankind desires to create something big, it
must reach down deep into the reservoir of its past.</q>
</p>

<p>
I wish now to quote a mystic philosopher. J. B.
von Helmont (1577-1644) writes: <q>That magic
power of man which is operative outside of him lies,
as it were, hidden in the inner life of mankind. It
sleeps and rules absolutely without being wakened,
yet daily as if in a drunken stupor within us....
Therefore we should pray to God, who can be honored
only in the spirit, that is, in the inmost soul of
man. Hence I say the art of the Cabala requires
of the soul that magic yet natural power shall, as
it were, after sleep has been driven away, be placed
in the keeping of the soul. This magic power has
<pb n="272"/><anchor id="Pg272"/>
gone, to sleep in us through sin and has to be awakened
again. This happens either through the illumination
of the Holy Ghost or a man himself can
by the art of the Cabala produce this power of
awakening himself at will. Such are called makers
of gold [nota bene!] whose leader (rector) is, however,
the spirit of God.... When God created the
soul of man he imparted to it fundamental and
primal knowledge. The soul is the mirror of the
universe and is related to all Being. It is illumined
by an inner light, but the storm of the passions, the
multiplicity of sensuous impressions, and other distractions
darken this light, whose beams are spread
abroad only, if it burns alone and if all in us is in
harmony and peace. If we know how to separate
ourselves from all external influences and are willing
to be led by this inner light, we shall find pure
and true knowledge in us. In this state of concentration
the soul distinguishes all objects to which it
directs its attention. It can unite with them, penetrate
their nature, and can itself reach God and in
him know the most important truths.</q> (Ennemoser,
Gesch. d. Mag., pp. 906, 914.)
</p>

<p>
Staudenmaier, who has experimented on himself
magically to a great extent and has set down his
experiences recently in the interesting book, <q>Die
Magie als experimentelle Naturwissenschaft,</q>
thinks he has observed that through the exercise
that he carries on, and which produces an intense
introversion, psychophysical energies are set free
that make him capable of greater efficiency. Specifically,
<pb n="273"/><anchor id="Pg273"/>
an actual drawing upon the nerve centers
unused in the conscious function of the normal man
of to-day would be available for intellectual work,
etc. So, as it were, a treasure can be gained (by
practices having a significant introversion character),
a treasure which permits an increased thinking and
feeling activity. If Staudenmaier, even in the critical
examination of his anomalous functions, can be
influenced by them, it would be a great mistake to
put them aside simply as <q>pathological.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ennemoser says of the danger of introversion
(l. c., p. 175): <q>Now where in men of impure
heart, through the destructive natural powers and
evil spiritual relations, the deepest transcendental
powers are aroused, dark powers may very easily
seize the roots of feeling and reveal moral abysses,
which the man fixed in the limits of time hardly suspects
and from which human nature recoils. Such
an illicit ecstasy and evil inspiration is at least recognized
in the religious teachings of the Jews and
Christians, and the seers of God describe it as an
agreement with hell (Isaiah XXVIII, 15).</q>
</p>

<p>
Whence comes the danger? It comes from the
powerful attraction for us of that world which is
opened to us through introversion. We descend
there to whet our arms for fresh battles, but we
lay them down; for we feel ourselves embraced by
soft caressing arms that invite us to linger, to dream
enchanting dreams. This fact coincides in large
part with the previously mentioned tendency toward
comfort, which is unwilling to forego childhood and
<pb n="274"/><anchor id="Pg274"/>
a mother's careful hands. Introversion is an excellent
road to lazy phantasying in the regressive direction.
</p>

<p>
Among psychopathologists Jung especially has of
late strongly insisted upon the dangerous rôle of
indolence. According to him the libido possesses
a monstrous laziness which is unwilling to let go of
any object of the past, but would prefer to retain
it forever. Laziness is actually a passion, as La
Rochefoucauld brilliantly remarks: <q>Of all the
passions the least understood by us is laziness; it is
the most indefatigable and the most malign of them
all, although its outrages are imperceptible.</q> <q>It
is the perilous passion affecting the primitive man
more than all others, which appears behind the suspicious
mask of the incest symbols, from which the
fear of incest has driven us away, and which above
all is to be vanquished under the guise of the
<q>dreaded mother.</q> [Vide, <ref target="Note_D">Note D</ref>. To avoid a
wrong conception of this quotation it must be noted
that laziness is, of course, not to be regarded as the
only foundation of incest symbolism.] She is the
mother of infinite evils, not the least of them being
the neurotic maladies. For especially from the
vapor of remaining libido residues, those damaging
evils of phantasy develop, which so enshroud reality
that adaptation becomes well nigh impossible.</q>
(Jung, Psychology of the Unconscious.)
</p>

<p>
That the indolent shrinking back from the difficulties
of life is indicated so frequently in psychology
and in mythology by the symbol of the mother
<pb n="275"/><anchor id="Pg275"/>
is not surprising, but I should yet like to offer for a
forceful illustration an episode from the war of
Cyrus against Astyages which I find recorded in
Dulaure-Krauss-Reiskel (Zeugg., p. 85.) After
Astyages had aroused his troops, he hurled himself
with fiery zeal at the army of the Persians, which
was taken unawares and retreated. Their mothers
and their wives came to them and begged them to attack
again. On seeing them irresolute the women
unclothed themselves before them, pointed to their
bosoms and asked them whether they would flee to
the bosoms of their mothers or their wives. This
reproachful sight decided them to turn about and
they remained victorious.
</p>

<p>
On the origin of the mythological and psychological
symbol of the dreaded mother: <q>Still there
appears to reside in man a deep resentment, because
a brutal law once separated him from an impulsive
indulgence and from the great beauty of the animal
nature so harmonious with itself. This separation
is clearly shown in the prohibition of incest and its
corollaries (marriage laws). Hence pain and indignation
are directed toward the mother as if she
were to blame for the domestication of the sons of
men. In order not to be conscious of his desire for
incest (his regressive impulse toward animal nature)
the son lays the entire blame on the mother, whence
results the image of the <q>dreaded mother.</q>
<q>Mother</q> becomes a specter of anxiety to him, a
nightmare.</q> (Jung, Psychology of the Unconscious.)
</p>

<pb n="276"/><anchor id="Pg276"/>

<p>
The snake is to be regarded as a mythological
symbol (frequent also in dream life) for the libido
that introverts itself and enters the perilous interdicted
precinct of the incest wish (or even only the
life shirking tendency); and especially (though not
always valid) is this conception in place, if the
snake appears as a terrifying animal (representative
of the dreaded mother). So also the dragon is
equivalent to the snake, and it can, of course, be
replaced by other monsters. The phallic significance
of the snake is, of course, familiar enough; the
snake as a poisonous terrible animal indicates, however,
a special phallus, a libido burdened with
anxiety. Jung, who has copious material with which
to treat this symbolism, calls the snake really a
<q>negative phallus,</q> the phallus forbidden with respect
to the mother, etc. I would recall that alchemy,
too, has the symbol of the snake or the
dragon, and used in a way that reënforces the preceding
conception. It is there connected with the
symbols of introversion and appears as <q>poisonous.</q>
The anxiety serpent is the <q>guardian of the threshold</q>
of the occultists; it is the treasure guarding
dragon of the myth. In mystic work the serpent
must be overcome; we must settle with the conflict
which is the serpent's soul.
</p>

<p>
Also the mystic yoga manuals of the Hindus know
the symbol of the serpent, which the introverting
individual has to waken and to overcome, whereupon
he comes into possession of valuable powers. These
serpents [kundalini] are considered by the Yogi
<pb n="277"/><anchor id="Pg277"/>
mystics as an obstacle existing in the human body
that obstructs certain veins or nerves (the anatomy
of the Hindu philosophers is rather loose here), and
by this means, if they are freed, the breath of life
(prāna) sends wondrous powers through the body.
The main path in the body which must be freed for
the increased life-energies is generally described as
the susumna (as far as I know, it is not yet cleared
up whether the aorta abdominalis or the spine has
furnished the anatomical basis for the idea of the
central canal), and is the middle way between two
other opposed canals of the breath, which are called
pingala, the right, and ida, the left. (Here, too,
note by the way, appears the comparison of opposites.)
I quote now several passages on the kundalini
and its significance at the beginning of the
mystical work.
</p>

<p>
<q>As Ananta, the Lord of Serpents, supports this
whole universe with its mountains and its forests,
so kundalini is the main support of all the yoga practices.
When kundalini is sleeping it is aroused by
the favor of the guru [spiritual teacher], then all
of the lotuses [lotus here stands for nerve center]
and granthis [swallowings, nerve plexus?] are
pierced. Then prana goes through the royal road,
susumna. Then the mind remains suspended and
the yogi cheats death.... So the yogi should carefully
practice the various mudras [exercises] to
rouse the great goddess [kundalini] who sleeps
closing the mouth of susumna.</q> (Hatha Yoga
Prad., Ill, 1-5.) <q>As one forces open a door
<pb n="278"/><anchor id="Pg278"/>
[door symbolism] with a key [the <q>Diederich</q> of
the wanderer in the parable] so the yogi should
force open the door of moksa [deliverance] by the
kundalini. The Paramesoari [great goddess]
sleeps, closing with her mouth the hole through
which one should go to the brahmarandhra [the
opening or place in the head through which the divine
spirit, the Brahma or the Atman, gets into the
body; the anatomical basis for this naïve idea may
have been furnished by one of the sutures of the
skull, possibly the sutura frontalis; the brahmarandhra
is probably the goal of the breath that
passes through the susumna that is becoming free.]
where there is no pain or misery. The kundalini
sleeps above the kanda. [The kanda, for which
we can hardly find a corresponding organ, is to be
found between the penis and the navel.] It gives
mukti to the yogis and bondage to the fools. [See
later the results of introspection.] He who knows
her, knows yoga. The kundalini is described as
being coiled like a serpent. He who causes that
sakti [probably, power] to move ... is freed without
doubt. Between the Ganges and the Yamuna
[two rivers of India, which are frequently used symbolically,
probably for the right and the left stream
of the breath of life, ingala and ida, cf. what follows]
there sits the young widow [an interesting
characterization of the kundalini] inspiring pity.
He should despoil her forcibly, for it leads one to
the supreme seat of Vishnu. Ida is the sacred
Ganges and pingala the Yamuna. Between ida and
<pb n="279"/><anchor id="Pg279"/>
pingala sits the young widow kundalini. You should
awake the sleeping serpent [kundalini] by taking
hold of its tail. That sakti, leaving off sleep, goes
up forcibly.</q> (Hatha-Yoga, Prad., III, 105-111.)
Ram Prasad (<q>Nature's Finer Forces,</q> p. 189)
writes about the kundalini: <q>This power sleeps in
the developed organism. It is that power which
draws in gross matter from the mother organism
through the umbilical cord and distributes it to the
different places, where the seminal prana gives it
form. When the child separates from the mother
the power goes to sleep.</q> Here the kundalini sakti
appears clearly in connection with the mother. Siva
is the god [father image] most peculiar to the yogis.
The wife of Siva, however, is called Kundalini.
</p>

<p>
Mythologically expressed, introversion proceeds
well if the hero defeats the dragon. If this does not
happen, an unsuccessful issue is the result; the man
loses himself. In my opinion this losing of self is
possible in two ways, one active, the other passive.
In all there would then be three terminations of introversion.
The good conclusion is the entrance
into the true mystical work, briefly, mysticism. The
bad conclusions are the active way of magic and the
passive one of schizophrenia (introversion psychosis).
In the first case there is consummated an
inner reunion, in the other two cases a losing of
self; in magic one loses oneself in passions, for which
one wishes to create satisfaction magically, absolving
oneself from the laws of nature; in the case of mental
malady the sinking develops into laziness, a spiritual
<pb n="280"/><anchor id="Pg280"/>
death. The three paths followed by the introverting
individual correspond roughly to these three
other possibilities of life, work (morality), crime,
suicide. These three possibilities are, of course,
recognized by the hermetic art; it recognizes three
fundamental powers, which can give no other result
psychically. Two of these principles are mutually
opposed (in the unpurified condition of the material).
We know them quite well as [Symbol: Fire] and [Symbol: Water], etc.
The third principle lies evenly between the other
two, like the staff of Hermes between the two serpents.
So the symbol [Symbol: Mercurius], as Hermes' staff with the
serpents, precisely unites all three. In this aspect
the three qualities or constituents of matter (prakrti)
may at once be substituted for the three fundamental
powers of alchemy according to the Hindu samkhya
doctrine. Sattva, Rajas, Tamas, are translated (by
Schroeder) by <q>purity, passion, darkness.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the Bhagavad-Gita it is said of the happiness
that these three grant:

<q>Passion</q> and <q>darkness,</q> Rajas and Tamas,
(in alchemy indicated by [Symbol: Fire] and [Symbol: Water], also often by
[Symbol: Mars] and [Symbol: Venus]) indicate the wrong way, the peril in introversion.
They lead to what Gorres (Christl.
Myst.) describes as the <q>demoniac</q> mysticism as
opposed to the divine mysticism. All mystic manuals
warn us of the wrong way and emphasize often
that we can easily lose the way even where there is
good intention. The evil one knows how, by illusions,
to make the false way deceptively like the
right one, so that the righteous man, who is not on
his guard, may get unsuspectingly into the worst entanglements.
Careful examination of himself, exact
observation of the effect of the spiritual exercises,
is to be laid to heart by every one. Yet powers
come into play that have their roots in the deepest
darkness of the soul (in the unconscious) and which
are withdrawn from superficial view. [After this
had been written I read a short paper of Dr. Karl
Furtmüller, entitled <q>Psychoanalyse und Ethik,</q>
and find there, p. 5, a passage which I reproduce
here on account of its agreement with my position.
I must state at the outset that according to Furtmüller,
psychoanalysis is peculiarly qualified to
arouse suspicion against the banal conscience, which
leads self-examination into the realm of the conscious
<pb n="282"/><anchor id="Pg282"/>
only, with neglect of the unconscious impulses, which
are quite as important for the performance of actions.
The passage of interest to us here reads:
<q>There is no lack of intimation that these fundamental
facts which place the whole of life in a new
perspective, were recognized or suspected even in
earlier times. If early Christianity believed that
demons could overpower the heart of man in the
sense that they assumed the voice of God, and the
man believed that, while really doing the devil's
work he was doing the work of God, then that sounds
like a symbolic representation of the play of the
forces that are described above.</q> The play of these
forces was indeed known to cultivated religious peoples
of all times. As for Christianity, what the author
asserts of its beginnings can be accepted as true
for a much earlier time. We already know that one
of the first works of mysticism consists in the education
of the conscience, in a most subtle purification
of this judicial inner eye. The claims of the
psychoanalyst are there fulfilled to the uttermost.]
Instead of many examples I gladly quote a single
one, but an instructive exposition by Walter Hitton,
a great master of the contemplative life, from his
<q>Scala Perfectionis</q> as Beaumont (Tract. v. Gust.
pub. 1721, pp. 188 ff.) renders it. Thus he writes:
<q>From what I said we can to some extent perceive
that visions and revelations, or any kind of spirit
in bodily appearance, or in the imagination in sleep
or waking, or any other sensation in the bodily senses
that are, as it were, spiritually performed, either
<pb n="283"/><anchor id="Pg283"/>
through a sound in the ears or taste in the mouth or
smell in the nose, or any other perceptible heat of
fiery quality that warms the breast or any other part
of the body, or any other thing that can be felt by
a bodily sense, even if it is not so refreshing and
agreeable, all this is not contemplation or observation;
but in respect of the spiritual virtues, and those
of celestial perception and love towards God, which
accompany true contemplation, only evil secondary
matters, even if they appear to be laudable and good.
All such kinds of sensation may be good if produced
by a good angel, but may, however, proceed
in a deceptive manner, from the impositions of a
bad angel, if he disguises himself as an angel of light.
For the devil can imitate in bodily sensations exactly
the same things that a good angel can accomplish.
Indeed, just as the good angels come with light, so
can the devil do also. And just as he can fabricate
this in things that appear to the eyes, so he can bring
it to pass in the other senses. The man who has
perceived both can best say which is good and which
is evil. But whoever knows neither or only one, can
very easily be deceived.</q>
</p>

<p>
Externally, in the sense quality, they are all similar,
but internally they are very different. And
therefore we should not too strongly desire them,
nor lightly maintain that the soul can distinguish between
the good and evil by the spirit of difference,
so that it may not be deceived. As St. John says:
<q>Believe not every spirit, but prove it first whether
it be of God or not.</q> And to know whether the
<pb n="284"/><anchor id="Pg284"/>
perception of the bodily sense is good or evil, Hitton
gives the following rule:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>If ye see an unusual light or brilliance with
your bodily eye, or in imagination, or if ye hear any
wonderful supernatural sound with your ears, or if
ye perceive a sudden sweet taste in your mouths or
feel any warmth in your breasts, like fire, or any
form of pleasure in any part of your body, or if ye
see a spirit in a bodily form, as if he were an angel
to fortify or instruct you, or if any such feeling that
you know comes not from you or from a physical
creature, then observe yourselves with great care at
such a time and consider the emotions of your heart
prudently. For if ye become aware by occasion of
pleasure or satisfaction derived from such perception,
that your hearts are drawn away from the contemplation
of Jesus Christ and from spiritual exercises:
as from prayer, and knowledge of yourselves
and your failings, and from the turning in towards
virtue and spiritual knowledge and perception of
God, with result that your heart and your inclinations,
your desire and your repose depend chiefly on
the above mentioned feeling or sight, in that ye
therefore retain them, as if that were a part of the
celestial joy or angelic bliss, and therefore your
thoughts become such that ye neither pray nor can
think of anything else, but must entirely give way
to that, in order to keep it and satisfy yourself with
it, then this sensation is very much to be suspected
of coming from the Enemy; and therefore were it
<pb n="285"/><anchor id="Pg285"/>
ever so wonderful and striking, still renounce it and
do not consent to accept it. For this is a snare of
the Enemy, to lead the soul astray by such bodily
sensation or agreeableness of the senses, and to trap
it in order to hurl it into spiritual arrogance and
false security, which happens if it flatters itself as
if it enjoyed celestial bliss and on account of the
pleasure it feels were already half in paradise, while
it is still in fact at the gate of hell, and therefore
through pride and presumptuousness may have fallen
into error, heresy, fanaticism and other bodily or
spiritual disaster.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In case, however, that these things do not result
in leading away your heart from spiritual exercises,
but cause ye to become ever more devout and more
ardent in prayer and more wise to cultivate spiritual
thoughts; if ye are at first astonished but nevertheless
your heart turns back and is awakened to greater
longing for virtue and your love toward God and
your neighbor increases more and more, and makes
you ever meeker in your own eyes; then you may
infer from this sign that it is of God and comes from
the presence and action of a good angel, and comes
from the goodness of God, either for comfort to
simple pious souls to increase their trust in and longing
for God, and because of such a strengthening to
seek more thoroughly for the knowledge and love
of God. Or if they are perfect that perceive such
a pleasure, it appears to them somewhat like a foretaste
and shadow of the transfiguration of the body
<pb n="286"/><anchor id="Pg286"/>
which it may expect in the celestial bliss.</q> However,
I do not know whether such a man can be
found on earth.
</p>

<p>
<q>He continues: Of this method of distinguishing
between the works of the spirits, Saint John
(I John IV, 3) speaks in his epistle: <q>Every spirit
that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh is not of God</q> (or as it is translated by Luther:
<q>Who does not recognize that Jesus Christ is come
into the flesh</q>). This union and connection of
Jesus with the human soul is caused by a good will
and a zealous striving toward him, which alone desires
to possess him and to view him spiritually in his
blessedness. The greater this longing the more
closely is Jesus united with the soul, and the less the
longing, the more loosely is he bound to him. So
every spirit or every sensation that diminishes this
longing, and draws it away from the steadfast contemplation
of Jesus Christ and from sighing and
longing like a child for him, this spirit will release
Jesus from the soul, and therefore it is not from
God but the activity of the Enemy. But if a spirit
or a sensation increases this desire, fastens the bonds
of love and devotion closer to Jesus, raises the
eyes of the soul to spiritual knowledge more and
more, and makes the heart ever meeker, this spirit
is from God.</q>
</p>

<p>
In many of the modern theosophic introversion
methods, borrowed from the Hindu yoga doctrines,
we find the exhortation to attach no importance to
the marvels appearing beside the real prize, indeed
<pb n="287"/><anchor id="Pg287"/>
to regard them as a pernicious by-product. The
Hindu doctrine calls them Siddhi. Walter Hitton
speaks of them as <q>inferior subordinate matters.</q>
From the description of them it appears that they
are phantastic appearances, which partly flatter the
wish for power, partly other wishes. [See <ref target="Note_E">Note E</ref>
at the end of this volume.] The Siddhi are qualified
to captivate weak minds with their jugglery.
Erotic experiences are connected very easily with
them because, going over into the regressive phase,
they show their <q>titanic</q> countenances. I have
with some daring, but not without right, just cited
the Siddhi as the anagogic equivalent of autoerotism.
The regressive phase, however, appears
as soon as one indulges in the gratification of the
Siddhi. It is not the Siddhi themselves that are the
evil (I regard them indeed as anagogic), but the
losing of oneself in them. They can be both divine
and diabolic. That depends on one's attitude
towards them.
</p>

<p>
In the result of introversion, the diabolic mysticism
is opposed, as we saw, to the divine. The true
mysticism is characterized by the extension of personality
and the false by the shrinking of personality.
We can also say, by an extension or shrinking of the
sphere of interest that determines the socially valuable
attitude. I say advisedly <q>sphere of interest,</q>
for mysticism in the end will not merely fulfill the
social law without love, but it labors for the bringing
out of this very love. It is not satisfied with
superficially tincturing the substance into gold (i.e.,
<pb n="288"/><anchor id="Pg288"/>
among other meanings, to get man to do good externally);
but it would change the substance completely,
make it gold through and through (i.e., to
orient the entire impulse power of man for good, so
that he desires this good with the warmth of love
and therefore finds his good fortune in virtue).
Only the good and not the good fortune is chosen
as the leading star, as I must note in order to avoid
a misconception about the hermetic procedure.
Happiness arises only at a certain point, and seems
to me like a fruit ripened in the meantime. The
most subtle representatives of this doctrine among
the alchemists are not so far, after all, from the
Kantian ethics.
</p>

<p>
Alchemistic ethics presupposes that there is an
education, an ennobling of the will. The person
that wills can learn to encompass infinitely much in
his ego. [Cf. Furtmüller (Psychoanalyse und
Ethik, p. 15): <q>The individual can ... make
the commands of others his own.</q> He quotes
Goethe (Die Geheimnisse):
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>From the law which binds all being</l>
<l>The man is freed who masters himself.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
The poles of shrinking and extension are the following:
The magician and the pathological introversionist
contract the sphere of their interest upon
the narrowest egoism. The mystic expands it immensely,
in that he comprises the whole world in
himself. The person egotistically entering into introversion
can preserve his happiness only by a firm
<pb n="289"/><anchor id="Pg289"/>
self-enclosure before the ever threatening destruction;
the mystic is free. The mystic's fortune consists
in the union of his will with the world will or as
another formula expresses it, in the union with God.
[On the freeing effect of the merging of one's own
will into a stronger cf. my essays Jb. ps. F., III,
pp. 637 ff., and IV, p. 629.] This fortune is
therefore also imperishable (gold). The reader
must always bear in mind that the mystic never
works on anything but on the problem of mankind
in general; only he does so in a form of intensive
life, and it may indeed be the case that the powers
which introversion furnish him, actually make possible
a more dynamic activity and a greater result.
For my part I am strongly inclined to believe it.
</p>

<p>
On the extension of personality, some passages
from the Discourses on Divinity in the Bhagavad-Gita:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Who sees himself in all being and all being in himself,</q></l>
<l>Whoever exercises himself in devotion and looks at all impartially,</l>

<l><q rend='post'>Wounds not the self through the self, and travels so the highest
road.</q> XIII 27f.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<pb n="290"/><anchor id="Pg290"/>

<p>
These passages elucidate the progressive function
of the idea of God in the <q>work.</q> Incidentally, I
believe that the devotional doctrines (Yoga) which
are theoretically based on the Samkhya philosophy
that originated without a God, has for good practical
reasons taken the idea of isvara (God) into its
system. Concentration requires an elevated impalpable
object as an aim. And this object must have
the property of being above every reach of the
power to grasp and yet apparently to seem attainable.
God has furthermore the functions of the
bearer of conflicts and hopes. At the beginning of
the work indeed the obstructing conflicts still exist.
A certain unburdening is accomplished by leaving
the conflict to the divinity, and frees the powers that
were at first crippled under the pressure of the conflicts.

Freud Kl. Schr., II, p. 131.]

<p>
The idea of the education of the will has, of
course, been familiar for a long time to ethical
writers, even if it has at times been lost sight of.
</p>

<p>
Aristotle is convinced that morality arises from
<pb n="291"/><anchor id="Pg291"/>
custom and convention. <q>As we learn swimming
only in water, and music by practice on an instrument,
so we become righteous by righteous action
and moderate and courageous by appropriate acts.
From uniform actions enduring habits are formed,
and without a rational activity no one becomes good
... being good is an act. Good is never by nature;
we become good by a behavior corresponding
to a norm. We possess morality not by nature but
against nature. We have the disposition to attain
it ... we must completely win it by habit. As
Plato says, in agreement with this, the proper education
consists in being so led from youth upward,
as to be glad and sorry about the things over which
we should be glad and sorry. But if by a course of
action in accordance with custom, a definite direction
of the will has been secured, then pleasure and
pain are added to the actions that result from the
will and, as it were, as signs, that here a new nature
is established in man.</q> (Jodl. Gesch. d. Eth., I,
pp. 44 ff.) <q>The energy and the proud confidence
in human power with which Aristotle offers to man
his will and character formation as his own work,
the emphasis with which he has opposed to the quietistic
<q>velle non discitur</q> (we cannot educate volition
nor learn to will, as later pessimistic opinions have
expressed it axiomatically) with the real indispensability
and at the same time the possibility of the
formation of the will; this contention is admirable
and quite characteristic of the methods of thought
of ancient philosophy at its height.</q> (Jodl., l. c.,
<pb n="292"/><anchor id="Pg292"/>
p. 49.) [Velle non discitur has been popularized
by Schopenhauer.]
</p>

<p>
In Philo and the related philosophers there appears
quite clearly the thought that gained such wide
acceptance later among the Christian ascetics, that
the highest development of moral strength was attainable
only through a long continued and gradually
increasing exercise, an ethical gymnastics. Philo,
moreover, uses the word Askesis to describe what
elsewhere had been described as bodily exercise.
The occidental spiritual exercise corresponds to the
Hindu yoga.
</p>

<p>
In the domestication of man through countless
generations, social instincts must have been established,
which appear as moral dispositions. I recall
the moral feeling in Shaftesbury. The social life
of man, for instance, plays with Adam Smith a significant
rôle, and yet even with him the moral law
is not something ready from the very beginning, not
an innate imperative, but the peculiar product of
each individual. The development of conscience receives
an interesting treatment by Smith. There
takes place in us a natural transposition of feelings,
mediated through sympathy, which arouse in each
of us the qualities of the other, and we can say <q>that
morality in Smith's sense, just as Feuerbach taught
later, is only reflected self-interest, although Smith
himself was quite unwilling to look at sympathy as
an egotistic principle. By means of a process that
we can almost call a kind of self-deception of the
imagination, we must look at ourselves with the eyes
<pb n="293"/><anchor id="Pg293"/>
of others, a very sensible precaution of nature,
which thus has created a balance for impulses that
otherwise must have operated detrimentally. [Bear
in mind what I have said above about intro-determination.]
This transposition which sympathy effects
we cannot escape; it itself appears when we know
that we are protected from the criticism of another
by the complete privacy of our own doings. It alone
can keep us upright when all about us misunderstand
us and judge us falsely. For the actual judgments
of another about us form, so to speak, a first
court whose findings are continually being corrected
by that completely unpartisan and well informed witness
who grows up with us and reacts on all our
doings.</q> (Jodl., l. c., I, pp. 372 ff.)
</p>

<p>
The derivation of the moral from selfish impulses
by transposition does not resolve ethics into egoism,
as Helvetius would have us believe. It is <q>a caricature
of the true state of things to speak of self-interest,
when we have in mind magnanimity and
beneficence, and to maintain that beneficence is nothing
but disguised selfishness, because it produces joy
or brings honor to the person that practices it.</q>
(L. c., p. 444.)
</p>

<p>
The ethical evolution which takes place as an extension
of personality demands, the more actively it
is practiced, the removal of resistances which operate
against the expansion of the ego. It cannot be denied
that hostile tendencies, which are linked with
pusillanimous views, are always on hand and create
conflicts. If they were not, the moral task would
<pb n="294"/><anchor id="Pg294"/>
be an easy one. Now as man cannot serve two masters,
so in the personal psychical household, the
points of view which have been dethroned, as far
as they will not unite with the newly acquired ones,
must be killed, and ousted from their power. Most
of all must this process be made effective if the development
is taken up intensively in the shape of
introversion. It must appear also in the symbolism.
</p>

<p>
Already in the lecanomantic experiments we are
struck by the dying of the figure (old man) that represents
the old form of conscience that has been overcome.
It is that part of Lea's psyche that resists
the new, after the manner of old people (father
type). In order that the new may be suppressed,
it must be immolated; at every step in his evolution
man must give up something; not without sacrifice,
not without renunciation, is the better attained.
The sacrifice must come, of course, before the new
reformed life begins. The hermetic representations
do not indeed always follow chronological order,
yet the sacrifice is usually placed at the beginning, as
introversion. In the parable the wanderer kills the
lion, well at the beginning. He sacrifices something
in so doing. He kills himself, i.e., a part of himself,
in order to be able to rise renewed (regenerated).
This process is the first mystical death, also called
by the alchemists, putrefaction or the blacks. This
death is often fused with the symbol of introversion,
because both can appear under the symbol of the
entrance into the mother or earth. Only by closer
<pb n="295"/><anchor id="Pg295"/>
examination can it sometimes be seen which process
is chiefly intended.
</p>

<p>
<q>And that shalt thou know my son, whoso does
not know how to kill, and to bring about a rebirth,
to make the spirits revive, to purify, to make bright
and clear ... he as yet knows nothing and will accomplish
nothing.</q> (Siebengestirn, p. 21.)
</p>

<p>
<q>These are the two serpents sent by Juno (which
is the metallic nature) which the strong Hercules
(i.e., the wise man in his cradle) has to strangle, i.e.,
to overpower and kill, in order in the beginning of
his work to have them rot, be destroyed and to
bear.</q> (Flamel, p. 54.)
</p>

<p>
Again and again the masters declare that one cannot
attain to true progress except by means of the
blacks, death and putrefaction.
</p>

<p>
In the <q>Clavis philosophiae et alchymiae Fluddanae,</q>
of the year 1633, we read: <q>Know then
that it is the duty of spiritual alchemy to mortify
and to refine all obscuring prejudice as corruptible
and vain, and so break down the tents of darkness
and ignorance, so that that imperishable but still beclouded
spirit may be free and grow and multiply in
us through the help of the fiery spirit, full of grace,
which God so kindly moistened, so as to increase it
from a grain to a mountain. That is the true alchemy
of which I am speaking, that which can multiply
in me that rectangular stone, which is the cornerstone
of my life and my soul, so that the dead in
me shall be awakened anew, and arise from the old
<pb n="296"/><anchor id="Pg296"/>
nature that had become corrupted in Adam, as a
new man who is new and living in Christ, and therefore
in that rectangular stone....</q>
</p>

<p>
To the <q>sacrifice</q> of the person introverting,
Jung devotes an entire chapter in his Psychology of
the Unconscious, Chapt. IV. A brief résumé of it
would show that by the sacrifice is meant the giving
up of the mother, i.e., the disclaiming of all bonds
and limitations that the soul has carried over from
childhood into adulthood. The victory over the
dragon is equivalent to the sacrificing of the regressive
(incestuous) tendency. After we have sought
the mother through introversion we must escape
from her, enriched by the treasure which we have
gotten.
</p>

<p>
The sacrifice of a part of ourself (killing of the
dragon, the father, etc.) is, as Jung points out, represented
also in mythology by the shooting with
sharp arrows at the symbol of the libido. The symbol
of the libido is generally a sun symbol. Now
it is particularly noteworthy that the VIII key of
the alchemist Basilius Valentinus (see figure 3, <ref target="Pg199">p.
199</ref>) shows arrows being shot, which are aimed at
the [Symbol: sun] (this libido symbol par excellence) that is
aptly used as a <q>target.</q> Death is clearly enough
accentuated and correlated with the sinking of the
corns of wheat into the earth. [John XII, 24, 25,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat
fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but
if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that
loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
<pb n="297"/><anchor id="Pg297"/>
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.]
As this rises, so also will the dying mystic rise. The
grave crosses have the form [Symbol: Fire] ([Symbol: Sulphur]); they show that
the interred one is a certain sulphur, the impure sulphur,
willfulness. The birds, from which we are
to protect the grain, may in the end be the Siddhi;
they are, in the introversion form of the religious
work, what would otherwise be merely <q>diversions</q>
or <q>dissipations.</q>
</p>

<p>
The mystical death is the death of egoism (in
Hindu terminology ahamkāra). Jacob Boehme
writes in his book of the true atonement, I, 19:
<q>... Although I am not worthy, [Jesus] take me
yet in thy death and let me only in thy death die my
death; still strike thou me in my acknowledged selfishness
to the ground and kill my selfishness by thy
death....</q> In the Mysterium Magnum, XXXVI,
74, 75: <q>... We exalt not the outspoken word
of the wisdom of God, but only the animal will to
selfishness and egoism which is departed from God,
which honors itself as a false God of its own and
may not believe or trust God (as the Antichrist who
has placed himself in God's stead); and we teach on
the contrary that the man of the Antichrist's image
shall wholly die so that he may be born in Christ of
a new life and will, which new will has power in the
perfect word of nature with divine eyes to see all the
miracles of God, both in nature and creature, in the
perfect wisdom. For as dies the Antichrist in the
soul, so rises Christ from the dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the hermetic book, <q>Gloria Mundi,</q> it is related
<pb n="298"/><anchor id="Pg298"/>
of Adam that he would have been able, if he
had not acted contrary to God, to live 2000 years
in paradise and would then have been taken up into
heaven; but he had drawn on himself death, sickness
and calamity. Only through the grace of God was
he given a partial knowledge of the powers of
things, of herbs and remedies against manifold infirmities.
<q>When, however, he could no longer
maintain himself by the medicinal art [in paradise]
he sent his son Seth forth to paradise for the tree
of life, which he received, not physically, but spiritually.
Finally he desired the oil of compassion,
whereupon by the angels, at God's command to give
the oil, the promise was given and thereupon the
seed of the oil tree sent, which seed Seth planted
on his return, after his father's death and on his
father's grave, from which grew the wood of the
holy cross, on which our Lord Jesus Christ, through
his passion and death, freed us from death and all
sins; which Lord Christ in his holiest humanity has
become the tree and the wood of life and has brought
to us the fruit of the oil of compassion....</q>
Adam is the undomesticated man; this ideal must die
to the moral aspirant.

The painful duty of killing a part of self is beautifully
expressed in the Bhagavad-Gita, where the
hero, Aryuna, hesitates to fight against his <q>kindred,</q>
to shoot at them&mdash;the bow falls from his
hand.

Dying relates to the old realms. The old laws
expire to make room for the new. The new life
<pb n="299"/><anchor id="Pg299"/>
cancels the old deeds. (Cf. Paul, Rom. VII-VII.)

<p>
Vedanta doctrine: But as to the duty of the
scripture canon and perception, both last as long
as Samsāra, i.e., until the awakening. If this is attained,
perception is annulled, and if you derive
thence the objection that thereby the veda is annulled,
it must be noted that according to our own
doctrine father is not father and the Veda is not the
veda. (Deussen, Syst. d. Ved., p. 449.)

For several reasons the father image is peculiarly
suited to represent what has to be resolved. By the
father, the old Adam (totality of inherited instincts)
and the strongest imperatives are implanted in the
child. The father is also the type of tenacious adherence
to the ancestors. Again we meet the antithesis,
old generation, new generation, in ourselves
after the intro-determination.

The mystical death (sacrifice) is not to be accomplished
by mere asceticism, as it were, mechanically;
the alchemists warn us carefully against severe remedies.
The work is to take a natural course; the
work is also, although indeed a consummation of
nature, yet not above nature.

The idea of self-sacrifice (with dismemberment)
appears very prettily in an allegorical vision of the
old hermetic philosopher Zosimos, who seems to
have copied it, as Reitzenstein notes, from an Egyptian
Nekyia. I quote from Hoefer (Hist. Chim.,
I, pp. 256-259):
</p>

<p>
<q>I slept and saw a priest standing before an altar
shaped like a cup and with several steps by which to
climb to it. [First 15, later 7 steps are mentioned.]
And I heard a voice crying aloud, <q>I have finished
climbing and descending these 15 steps, resplendent
with light.</q> After listening to the priest officiating
at the altar I asked him what this resounding voice
was whose sound had struck my ear. The priest
answered me, saying: <q>I am he who is (εἰμὶ ὁ ὤν),
<pb n="301"/><anchor id="Pg301"/>
the priest of the sanctuary, and I am under the
weight of the power that overwhelms me. For at
the break of day came a deputy who seized me, killed
me with a sword, cut me in pieces; and after flaying
the skin from my head, he mixed the bones with the
flesh and burned me in the fire to teach me that the
spirit is born with the body. That is the power that
overwhelms me.</q> While the priest was saying that,
his eyes became as blood, and he vomited all his
flesh. I saw him mutilate himself, rend himself with
his teeth and fall on the ground. Seized with terror
I awoke, and I began to ponder and ask myself if
this indeed was the nature and the composition of the
water. And I congratulated myself upon having
reasoned well [namely in a train of thought preceding
the vision]. Soon I slept again and perceived
the same altar, and on this altar I saw water boiling
with a noise and many men in it. Not finding any
one in the neighborhood to explain this phenomenon,
I advanced to enjoy the spectacle at the altar. Then
I noticed a man with gray hair and thin, who said
to me, <q>What are you looking at?</q> <q>I am looking,</q>
I answered with surprise, <q>at the boiling of the
water and the men who are boiling there still alive.</q>
<q>The sight you see,</q> replied he, <q>is the beginning,
the end and the transmutation (μεταβολή).</q> I asked
him what the transmutation was. <q>It is,</q> he said,
<q>the place of the operation which is called purification
[in the original, topos askeseos], for the people
who wish to become virtuous come there and become
spirits shunning the body.</q> And I asked him, <q>Are
<pb n="302"/><anchor id="Pg302"/>
you also a spirit [pneuma]?</q> <q>I am,</q> said he, <q>a
spirit and the guardian of spirits.</q> During this conversation
and amid the noise of the boiling water
and the cries of the people, I perceived a man of
brass, holding in his hand a book of lead, and I heard
him tell me in a loud voice: <q>See, I command all
those who are subjected to punishments to learn from
this book. I command every one to take the book
of lead and to write in it with his hand until his
pharynx is developed, the mouth is opened, and
the eyes have taken their place again.</q> The act
followed the word, and the master of the house,
present at this ceremony, said to me, <q>Stretch your
neck and see what is done.</q> <q>I see,</q> said I. <q>The
brazen man that you see,</q> said he, <q>and who has left
his own flesh, is the priest before the altar. It is
he who has been given the privilege of disposing of
this water.</q> In going over all this in my imagination
I awoke and said to myself, <q>What is the cause
of this occurrence? What indeed is it? Is it
not the water white, yellow, boiling, divine?</q> I
found that I had reasoned well.... Finally, to
be brief, build, my friend a temple of a single stone
[monolith] ... a temple that has neither beginning
nor end, and in the interior of which there is
found a spring of purest water, and bright as the
sun. It is with the sword in hand that one must
search and penetrate into it, for the entrance is narrow.
It is guarded by a dragon, which has to be
killed and flayed. By putting the flesh and the bones
together you make a pedestal up which you will
<pb n="303"/><anchor id="Pg303"/>
climb to reach the temple, where you will find what
you are looking for. For the priest, who is the
brazen man whom you saw sitting near the spring,
changes his nature and is transformed into a man
of silver, who can, if you wish, change himself into
a man of gold.... Do not reveal anything of this
to any one else and keep these things for yourself,
for silence teaches virtue. It is very fine to understand
the transmutation of the four metals, lead,
copper, tin, silver, and to know how they change
into perfect gold....</q>
</p>

<p>
Psychoanalysis, like comparative mythology,
makes it probable that the killing or dismemberment
of the father figure is equivalent to castration. That
has, according to intro-determination, an anagogic, a
wider sense, if we compare the organ of generation to
the creative power, and a narrower, if we compare it
to sexuality. The wider conception does not require
immediate interpretation. With regard to the narrower,
I observe that the mystical manuals show that
the most active power for spiritual education is the
sexual libido, which for that reason is partially or
entirely withdrawn from its original use. (Rules
of chastity.) <q>Vigor is obtained on the confirmation
of continence.</q> (Patanjali, Yoga-Sutra, II,
38.) These instruction books have recognized the
great transmutability of the sexual libido. (Cf.
ability of sublimation in the alchemistic, as well as
in the Freudian terminology.) Naturally the reduction
of sexuality had to occur at the beginning of
the work in order to furnish that power; hence the
<pb n="304"/><anchor id="Pg304"/>
castration at the commencement of the process.
The killing of the phallic snake amounts, of course,
to the same thing. The snake with its tail in its
mouth is the cycle of the libido, the always rolling
wheel of life, of procreation, which always procreates
itself, and of the creation of the world. The
same cycle is represented by a god who holds his
phallus in his mouth, and so (in accordance with
infantile and primitive theory) constantly impregnates
himself. The serpent is good and also evil.
Whoever breaks through the ring frees himself from
the wheel of compulsion, raises himself above good
and evil, in order to put in its place later a mystical
union [Hieros Gamos].
</p>

<p>
Regarded from the point of view of knowledge,
the formation of types reveals itself as a symbolic
presentiment of an anagogic idea, not at first clearly
conceivable. For the spirit, what cannot yet be
clearly seen (mythological level of knowledge) or
can no longer be seen (going to sleep, etc.) is pictured
in symbolic form. [More details will be
found in my essays, <q>Phantasie und Mythos,</q>
<q>Ueber die Symbolbildung,</q> and <q>Zur Symbolbildung</q>
(Jb. ps. F., II, III, IV).] This symbol form
is the form of knowledge adapted to the spirit's capacity
as it then existed. Not that any mysterious
presentiment or prophetic gift of vision must be assumed.
The circumstance that man can get ever
deeper meaning from his symbols gives them the
appearance of being celestial harbingers sent forth
by the latest ideas that they express. In a certain
<pb n="305"/><anchor id="Pg305"/>
sense, however, the last meaning is implicated in the
first appearance of the typical symbol. It has already
been explained by intro-determination how
that was possible. The psyche, whose inventory of
powers is copied symbolically in the elementary
types, knows, even if only darkly at first, the possible
unfolding of the powers. These unfoldings are
originally not actual but potential. [See <ref target="Note_F">Note F</ref>.]
</p>

<p>
The more then that the psyche is so developed,
that what was originally only a possible presentiment
of actuality and that hence tends to come
nearer the merely potential, begins to become actual,
the more symbolism has the value of a <q>program.</q>
According to Jung, Riklin, etc., the phantasy (dream,
myth-making) can be conceived not only as with
Freud, <q>as a wish fulfillment, wherein older and
infantile material expresses the wish for something
unsettled, unattained or suppressed, but also as a
mythological first step in the direction of conscious
and adapted thinking and acting, as a program....
Maeder has discussed the teleological functions
of the dream and the unconscious. In the
course of an analytic treatment we discover the continuous
transformations of the libido symbol in
the dream current, till a form is reached which
serves as an attempt to adapt oneself to actuality.
There are epochs in the history of civilization which
are particularly characterized by a storing of the
libido in the sense that from the reservoir of mythological
and religious thought forms, new adaptations
to the real processes and data are made. A significant
<pb n="306"/><anchor id="Pg306"/>
example is the Renaissance, which a study of
renaissance literature and a visit to the renaissance
cities, e.g., Florence, make evident in a high degree.
The analysis of romanticism ... confirms these
processes of development.</q> (Zentralblatt f. Psa.,
III, p. 114.)
</p>

<p>
We have here the thought that the <q>program</q>
is expressed in art, which therefore has prescience
in a certain degree of the coming event. Jung (Jb.
ps. F., III, pp. 171 ff.) writes: <q>It is a daily experience
in my professional work (an experience
whose certainty I must express with all the caution
that is required by the complexity of the material)
that in certain cases of chronic neuroses, a dream
occurs at the time of the onset of the malady or a
long time before, frequently of visionary significance,
which is indelibly imprinted on the memory and
holds a meaning, concealed from the patient, which
anticipates the succeeding experiences, i.e., the psychological
significance. Dreams appear to stay spontaneously
in memory so long as they suitably outline
the psychological situation of the individual.</q>
</p>

<p>
The more the program is worked out the more
the value of the symbolism (whose types can always
remain the same in spite of changes in their appearance)
changes into that of the functional symbolism
in the narrower sense; for the functional symbolism
in the restricted sense is that which copies the actual
play of forces in the psyche.
</p>

<p>
To the functional symbolism of actual forces belong,
e.g., in large part the faces in my lecanomantic
<pb n="307"/><anchor id="Pg307"/>
experiments, although they also contain program
material; further, in purest form, the previously
related autosymbolic vision of the mountains. The
progress of a psychoanalytic treatment is, apart
from the program connections, generally copied in
the dream in correspondence to the momentary
psychic status, and therefore actually and functionally.
It is quite probable that the progress of the
mystical work is represented to the mystic in his
phantasying (dreams, visions, etc.) in a symbolic
manner. But when one happens upon written
phantasy products of the mystics, of course only he
who has mystical experiences of his own can venture
to say whether a program symbolism or an actually
functional symbolism is exhibited. For example, I
make no judgment on the degree of actuality in the
anagogic symbolism of the parable.

<p>
In the favorable issue of introversion, i.e., when
we conquer the dragon, we liberate a valuable treasure,
namely, an enormous psychic energy, or, according
to the psychoanalytic view, libido, which is applicable
to the much desired new creation (as the titanic
aspect of which we recognize the <q>reforming</q>).
The symbolic type, either openly or hiddenly expressed,
of the setting free of an active libido, is
birth. A libido symbol with the characteristic of
active life comes out of a mother symbol. (The
former is either explicitly a child or even a food, or
it is phallic or animal. Zbl. Psa., III, p. 115.) As
<pb n="308"/><anchor id="Pg308"/>
the mystic is author of this, his birth, he has become
his own father.
</p>

<p>
Introversion (seeking for the uterus or the grave)
is a necessary presupposition of regeneration or
resurrection, and this is a necessary presupposition
of the mystical creation of the new man. (John III,
1-6): <q>There was a man of the Pharisees named
Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to
Jesus by night [introversion] and said unto him,
<q>Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from
God; for no man can do these miracles that thou
doest except God be with him.</q> Jesus answered and
said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except
a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man
be born when he is old? Can he enter the second
time into his mother's womb and be born? Jesus
answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born
of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the Spirit
is spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
Water is one of the most general religious mother
symbols (baptism). With the earliest alchemists
the brazen man becomes silver, the silver man, gold,
by being dipped in the holy fountain.
</p>

<p>
A mythological representation of introversion
with its danger and with regeneration was given previously
[see Vishnu's adventure]. Detailed examples
follow; first the Celtic myth of the birth of
Taliesin.
</p>

<pb n="309"/><anchor id="Pg309"/>

<p>
In olden times there was a man of noble parentage
in Peelyn named Tegid Voel. His ancestral
country was in the center of the lake of Tegid. His
wife was called Ceridwen. Of her he had a son,
Morvram ap Tegid, and a daughter, Creirwy, the
fairest maiden in the world. These two had another
brother, the ugliest of all beings, named
Avagddu. Ceridwen, the mother of this ill favored
son, well knew that he would have little success in
society, although he was endowed with many fine
qualities. She determined to prepare a kettle [introversion]
for her son, so that on account of his
skill in looking into the future [Siddhi] he should
find entrance into society. The kettle of water began
to boil [cooking of the child in the uterus vessel]
and the cooking had to be continued without
interruption till one could get three blessed drops
from the gifts of the Spirit [treasure]. She set
Gwyon, the son of Gwreang of Llanveir, to watch
the preparation of the kettle, and appointed a blind
man [mutilation or castration] named Morda to
keep alight the fire under the kettle, with the command
that he should not permit the interruption of
the boiling for a year and a day. [Cf. the activity
of the wanderer in the parable, Sec. 14 ff.] Meanwhile
Ceridwen occupied herself with the stars,
watched daily the movement of the planets, and
gathered herbs of all varieties that possessed peculiar
powers [Siddhis]. Towards the end of the
year, while she was still looking for herbs, it happened
that three drops of the powerful water flew
<pb n="310"/><anchor id="Pg310"/>
out of the kettle and fell on Gwyon's finger. They
scalded him and he stuck his finger in his mouth.
As the precious drops touched his lips all the events
of the future were opened to his eyes, and he saw
that he must be on his guard against Ceridwen
[dreaded mother]. He rushed home. The kettle
split into two parts [motive of the tearing apart of
the uterus], for all the water in it except the three
powerful drops were poisonous [danger of introversion],
so that it poisoned the chargers of Gwyddno
Garantur, which were drinking out of the gutter
into which the kettle had emptied itself [the flood].
Now Ceridwen came in and saw that her whole
year's work was lost. She took a pestle and struck
the blind man so hard on the head that one of his
eyes fell out on his cheeks. <q>You have unjustly
deformed me,</q> cried Morda; <q>you see that I am
guiltless. Your loss is not caused by my blunder.</q>
<q>Verily,</q> said Ceridwen, <q>Gwyon the Small it was
that robbed me.</q> Immediately she pursued him,
but Gwyon saw her from a distance and turned into
a hare and redoubled his speed, but she at once became
a hound, forced him to turn around and chased
him towards a river. He jumped in and became a
fish, but his enemy pursued him quickly in the shape
of an otter, so that he had to assume the form of a
bird and fly up into the air. But the element gave
him no place of refuge, for the woman became a
falcon, came after him and would have caught him
[forms of anxiety]. Trembling for fear of death,
he saw a heap of smooth wheat on a threshing floor,
<pb n="311"/><anchor id="Pg311"/>
fell into the middle of it and turned into a grain of
wheat. But Ceridwen took the shape of a black
hen, flew to the wheat, scratched it asunder, recognized
the grain and swallowed it [impregnation, incest].
She became pregnant from it and after being
confined for nine months [regeneration] she found
so lovely a child [improvement] that she could no
longer think of its death [immortality]. She put it
in a boat, covered it with a skin [skin = lanugo of
the fœtus, belongs to the birth motive], and at the
instigation of her husband cast the skiff into the
sea on the 29th of April. At this time the fish weir
of Gwyddno stood between Dyvi and Aberystwyth,
near his own stronghold. It was usual in this weir
every year on the 1st of May to catch fish worth
100 pounds. Gwyddno had an only son, Elphin.
He was very unfortunate in his undertakings, and
so his father thought him born in an evil hour. His
counselors persuaded the father, however, to let his
son draw the weir basket this time, to try whether
good luck would ever be his, and so that he might
yet gain something with which to go forth into the
world. On the next day, the 1st of May, Elphin
examined the weir basket and found nothing, yet as
he went away, he saw the boat covered with the
skin rest on the post of the weir. One of the fishermen
said to him, <q>You have never been so unlucky
as you were to-night, but now you have destroyed the
virtue of the weir basket,</q> in which they always
found a hundred pounds' worth on the first of May.
<q>How so?</q> asked Elphin. <q>The boat may easily
<pb n="312"/><anchor id="Pg312"/>
contain the worth of the hundred.</q> The skin was
lifted and he that opened it saw the forehead of a
child and said to Elphin, <q>See the beaming forehead.</q>
<q>Beaming forehead, Taliesin, be his
name,</q> replied the prince, who took the child in his
arms and because of his own misfortune, pitied it.
He put it behind him on his charger. Immediately
the child composed a song for the consolation and
praise of Elphin, and at the same time prophesied to
him his future fame. Elphin took the child into the
stronghold and showed him to his father, who asked
the child whether he was a human being or a spirit.
Whereupon he answered in the following song:
<q>I am Elphin's first bard; my native country is the
land of the cherubim. The heavenly John called
me Merddin [Merlin] and finally, every one, King:
Taliesin. I was nine months in the womb of my
mother Ceridwen, before which I was the little
Gwyon, now I am Taliesin. With my Lord I was
in the world above, and fell as Lucifer into the
depths of hell. I carried the banner before Alexander.
I know the names of the stars from north
to south. I was in the circle of Gwdion [Gwydi on]
in the Tetragrammaton. I accompanied the Hean
into the valley of Hebron. I was in Canaan when
Abraham was killed. I was in the court of Dve
before Gwdion was born, a companion of Eli and
Enoch. I was at the judgment that condemned the
Son of God to the cross. I was an overseer at Nimrod's
tower building. I was in the ark with Noah.
I saw the destruction of Sodom. I was in Africa
<pb n="313"/><anchor id="Pg313"/>
before Rome was built. I came hither to the remains
of Troy (i.e., to Britain, for the mystical progenitor
of the Britons boasted a Trojan parentage).
I was with my Lord in the asses' manger. I comforted
Moses in the Jordan. I was in the firmament
with Mary Magdalene. I was endowed with
spirit by the kettle of Ceridwen. I was a harper at
Lleon in Lochlyn. I suffered hunger for the son of
the maiden. I was in the white mountains in the
court of Cynvelyn in chains and bondage, a year and
a day. I dwelt in the kingdom of the Trinity [Tri-unity].
It is not known whether my body is flesh
or fish. I was a teacher of the whole world and
remain till the day of judgment on the face of the
earth. [Briefly, Taliesin has the ubiquity of [Symbol: Mercury].]
I sat on the shaken chair at Caer Seden [Caer Seden
is probably the unceasingly recurrent cycle of animal
life in the center of the universe.], which continually
rotates between the three elements. Is it not a marvel
that it does reflect a single beam?</q> Gwyddnaw,
astonished at the evolution of the boy, requested another
song and received the answer: <q>Water has
the property of bringing grace; it is profitable to devote
one's thoughts aright to God; it is good warmly
to pray to God, because the grace which goes out
from him cannot be thwarted. Thrice have I been
born; I know how one has to meditate. It is sad
that men do not come to seek all the knowledge of
the world, which is collected in my breast, for I know
everything that has been and everything that will
be.</q> (Nork. Myth. d. Volkss., pp. 662 ff.)
</p>

<pb n="314"/><anchor id="Pg314"/>

<p>
The story of Taliesin closely harmonizes with that
of Hermes in the Smaragdine tablet. Nork makes
some interesting observations, which besides the nature
myth interpretation, contains also an allusion to
the idea of spiritual regeneration.
</p>

<p>
I have already mentioned that the uterus symbol
is frequently the body cavity of a monster. Just as
in the previous myth the hero by introversion gets
three marvelous drops, so in the Finnish epic Kalevala,
Wäinämöinen learns three magic words in the
belly of a monster, his dead ancestor Antero
Wipunen. The gigantic size of the body of the being
that here and in other myths represents the
mother, has an infantile root. The introverting
person, as we know, becomes a child. To the child
the adults, and of course, the mother, are very large.
For the adult, who becomes a child and revives the
corresponding images, the mother image may easily
become a giant.
</p>

<p>
Stekel tells (Spr. d. Tr., p. 429) of a patient
whose dreams show uterus and regeneration phantasies
in concealed form, that he, advised of it by
Stekel, mused upon it some minutes and then said,
<q>I must openly confess to you these conscious phantasies.
I was 13 years old when I wished to become
acquainted with an enormously large giantess, in
whose body I might take a walk, and where I could
inspect everything. I would then make myself quite
comfortable and easy in the red cavern. I also
phantasied a swing that was hung 10 m. high in the
body of this giantess. There I wanted to swing up
<pb n="315"/><anchor id="Pg315"/>
and down joyfully.</q> This patient had carried over
the original proportion of fœtus and mother to his
present size. Now that he was grown up, the body
in which he could move had to be the body of a
giantess.
</p>

<p>
We shall now not be surprised at the flesh mountain
Krun of the mandæan Hibil-Ziwâ saga or similar
giant personalities. Hibil-Ziwâ descended into
the world of darkness in order to get the answer to
a question (i.e., once more the treasure in the form
of a marvelous word). He applied in vain to different
persons, but always had to go deeper and finally
came to Krûn, from whom he forced the magic word.
</p>

<p>
The treasure or wonder working name comes
from the depths according to the hermetic cabbalistic
conception also. David is supposed to have found
at the digging of the foundation of the temple, the
Eben stijjah, Stone of the Deeps, that unlocked the
fountain of the great deep (I Mos., VII, 11, and
VIII, 12) and on which the Sêm ha-mephorás, the
outspoken name (of God) was inscribed. This
stone he brought into the holy of holies, and on it
the ark of the covenant was set. Fearless disciples
of wisdom entered at times into the sanctuary and
had learned from the stone the name with its combinations
of letters in order to work wonders therewith.

In cases where the uterus is represented by the
body cavity of a monster the rebirth occurs most
frequently by a spitting forth. Also the breaking
forth by means of tearing apart the uterus occurs,
<pb n="316"/><anchor id="Pg316"/>
and in every case it has the significance of a <q>powerfully
tearing of oneself away,</q> the burning of
bridges behind one, the final victory over the mother.
To the descent into the underworld (introversion)
corresponds, as characteristic of the subsequent rebirth,
the rising to the light with the released treasure
(magic word as above, water of life, as in Ishtar's
hell journey, etc.).
</p>

<p>
A frequently used symbol for the released libido
is the light, the sun. Reborn sun figures, in connection
with a daily and yearly up and down, are
also quite general. That the released libido appears
thus may have several reasons. External ones, like
the life-imparting properties of the sun, invite comparison.
Then the parallel light = consciousness.
[Also that higher or other consciousness that is mediated
by the mystic religious work; for which expressions
like illuminate, etc., are sufficiently significant.
On this topic see my essay, Phant. u. Myth. (Jb., II,
p. 597).] and also inner reasons, i.e., such as rest
upon the actual light and warmth sensations, which
occur, as literature and observations show, in persons
who are devoted to spiritual training. Here
the occasion may be offered to the mystic to utilize
for conscious life and action, functions that hitherto
had been unconscious. Of the appearance of light
in the state of introversion, the histories of saints
and ecstatics, and the autobiographies of this kind
of men are full. An enormous number of instances
might be given. I shall rest content with recalling
that Mechthildis von Magdeburg has entitled her
<pb n="317"/><anchor id="Pg317"/>
revelations: <q>A flowing Light of my Godhead</q>
(<q>Ein vliessend Lieht miner Gotheit</q>), and with
adding Jane Leade's words: <q>If any one asks what
is the magic power [sought by the reborn] I answer,
<q>It is to be compared to a wonderfully powerful inspiration
to the soul, to a blood, coloring and penetrating
and transmuting the inner life, a concentrating
and essentially creative light and fire flame.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
The Omphalopsychites or Hesychiasts, those
monks who dwelt in the Middle Ages on Mount
Athos, were given the following instructions by their
Abbot Simeon: <q>Sitting alone in private, note and
do what I say. Close thy doors and raise thy spirit
from vain and temporal things. Then rest thy
beard on the breast and direct the gaze with all thy
soul on the middle of the body at the navel. [See
<ref target="Note_G">Note G</ref>.] Contract the air passages so as not to
breathe too easily. Endeavor inwardly to find the
location of the heart, where all psychic powers reside.
At first thou wilt find darkness and inflexible
density. When, however, thou perseverest day and
night, thou wilt, wonderful to relate, enjoy inexpressible
rapture. For then the spirit sees what it
never has recognized; it sees the air between the
heart and itself radiantly beaming.</q> This light, the
hermits declare, is the light of God that was visible
to the young men on Tabor.
</p>

<p>
Yoga-Sutra (Patanyali, I, 36) says: <q>Or that
sorrowless condition of mind, full of light (would
conduce to samadhi).</q> And the commentator
Manilal Nabubhai Dvivedi remarks upon this:
<pb n="318"/><anchor id="Pg318"/>
<q>The light here referred to is the light of pure
sattva. When the mind is deeply absorbed in that
quality, then, indeed, does this condition of light
which is free from all pain follow. Vachaspatimisra
remarks that in the heart there is a lotus-like form
having eight petals and with its face turned downward.
One should raise this up by rechaka (exhalation
of the breath) and then meditate upon it,
locating therein the four parts of the pranava, viz.,
a, u, m, and the point in their several meanings.
When the mind thus meditating falls in the way of
the susumna, it sees a perfect calm light like that of
the moor of the sun, resembling the calm ocean of
milk. This is the jyotis, light, which is the sure
sign of complete sattva. Some such practice is here
meant....</q> The similarity to the instruction of
the Abbot Simeon is evident.
</p>

<p>
The light and sun symbolism in alchemistic writings
is everywhere used; yet gold also = sun, indeed
the same sign [Symbol: Gold] serves for both. I should like to
call attention incidentally to a beautiful use of the
sun symbol in <q>Amor Proximi,</q> which differs
slightly from the more restricted gold symbolism.
On p. 32 ff. we read: <q>See Christ is not outside of
us, but he is intimately within us all, but locked up,
and in order that he may unlock that which is locked
up in us, did he once become outwardly visible, as a
man such as we are, the hard sin enclosure excepted,
and of this the [Symbol: Gold] in this world is the true copy,
which quickly convinced the heathens from the beginning
of the world that God must become man
<pb n="319"/><anchor id="Pg319"/>
even as the light of nature has become a body in
the [Symbol: Gold]. Now the [Symbol: Gold] is not alone in the firmament
outside of all other creatures, but it is much more
in the center of all creatures but shut up, but the
external [Symbol: Gold] is as a figure of Christ, in that it unlocks
in us the enclosed [Symbol: Gold], as its image and substance,
just as Christ does, through his becoming man, also
unlock in us the image of God. For were this not
so, then the sphere of the earth would approach in
vain to the [Symbol: Gold] in order to derive its power from it,
and nothing at all would grow from the accursed
[Symbol: earth]. [The symbol [Symbol: earth] means earth.] So the [Symbol: earth]
shows us that inasmuch as it approaches near to the
[Symbol: Gold] it is unlocked, so we, too, approaching Christ,
shall attain again the image of God; then at the
end of time this [Symbol: earth] will be translated into the point
of the sun [in Solis punctum] [Cf. what has been
said about the point in the [Symbol: Gold].];</q> and still farther
on: <q>Ye see that the [Symbol: earth] turns to the sun, but
the reason ye know not; if the earth had not in the
creation gone out of the Solis punctum, it could not
have turned and yearned according to its magnetic
manner, so this turning around shows us that the
world was once renewed, and in its beginning, as [Symbol: Gold]
is punctum; it desires to return, and its rest will be
alone in that; therefore the soul of man is also similarly
gone out of the eternally divine sun, towards
which it also yearns....</q>

Our parable, to which I should like now to revert,
appears in a new light. It would be a waste of time
to lead the reader once more through all the adventures
<pb n="320"/><anchor id="Pg320"/>
of the wanderer. He again, without difficulty,
will find all the aforesaid elements in the parable,
and will readily recognize the introversion and rebirth.
I therefore pick out for further consideration
only a few particular motives of the parable or
alchemy which seem to me to require special elucidation.
</p>

<p>
We should not forget the singular fact that after
the introversion, at the beginning of the work of
rebirth, a deluge occurs. This flood takes place not
merely in the alchemistic process (when the bodies
undergo putrefaction in the vessel and become
black), but we see the mythic deluges coming with
unmistakable regularity at the same time, i.e., after
the killing of the original being (separation of the
primal parents, etc.), and before the new creation
of the world by the son of God. Stucken (SAM., p.
123): <q>We see corroborated ... what I have
already emphasized, that on the appearance of the
flood catastrophe the creation of the world is not yet
finished. Even before the catastrophe there was indeed
an earth and life on it, but only after the flood,
begins the forming of the present Cosmos. Thus it
is in the germanic Ymir-saga, and in the Babylonian
Tiamat-saga, in the Egyptian and likewise in the
Iranian.</q> What may the flood be in the psychological
sense. Dreams and poetry tell us, in that they
figure the passions in the image of a storm-tossed
sea. After the introversion, whose perils have already
been mentioned, there is always an outbreak
of the passions. Not without consequences is the
<pb n="321"/><anchor id="Pg321"/>
Stone of the Deeps elevated, which locks the
prison of the subterranean powers. (Cf. Book of
Enoch, X, 5, and passim.) The point is to seize the
wildly rushing spirits and to get possession of their
powers without injury. The entire inundation must,
in the philosophical vessel, be absorbed by the bodies
that have turned black, and then it works on them
for the purpose of new creation, fructifying them
like the floods of water upon the earth. It does no
damage to the materia only then, when it is actually
black (stage of victory). If this happens, it (the
materia) is in contrast to the waters raging over it,
like an ocean which suffers no alteration by the influx
of waters. <q>Like an ocean that continually fills itself
and yet does not overflow its boundaries, even
with the inflowing waters, so the man acquires calm,
into whom all desires flow in similar wise, and not
he who wantonly indulges his desire.</q> (Bhag. Gita,
II, 70. Latin: translated by Schlegel: German
[Schroeder].)

Above I have compared the lion of the parable to
the Sphinx of Œdipus, and on the other hand, it appears
from later deliberation that it (the lion) must
be the retrogressive element in men, which is to be
sacrificed in the work of purification. Now I find
several remarks of Jung (Psychology of the Unconscious)
<pb n="322"/><anchor id="Pg322"/>
that mediate very well between both ideas.
Even if I do not care to go so far as to see in the
animal only the sexual impelling powers, but prefer
to regard it rather as the titanic part of our impulses,
I find the conception of the author very fortunate.
The Sphinx, that double being, symbolizes the double
natured man, to whom his bestiality still clings.
Indeed it is to be taken exactly as a functional representation
of the development of reason out of the
impulses (human head and shoulders growing out
of an animal body).
</p>

<p>
The homunculus motive would likewise have to be
regarded in a new light. I have said that the
mystic was his own father; he creates a new man
(himself) out of himself with a merely symbolic
mother, therefore with peculiar self-mastery, without
the coöperation of any parents. That means the
same thing as the artificial creation of a man. We
recognize therefore the anagogic significance of the
homunculus, the idea of which we found closely interwoven
with alchemy in general. This connection
also has not escaped Jung, though he takes it one-sidedly
and draws a too far-reaching conclusion.
He points to the vision of Zosimos, where, in the
hollow of the altar he finds boiling water and men
in it, and remarks that this vision reveals the original
sense of alchemy, an original impregnation
magic, i.e., a way in which children could be made
without a mother. I must observe that the hermetic
attempt to get back to Adam's condition has some of
the homunculus phantasy in it. Adam was regarded
<pb n="323"/><anchor id="Pg323"/>
as androgyne, a being at once man and woman, but
sufficient in himself alone for impregnation and procreation.
Welling says in his Opus mago-cabbalisticum,
<q>This man Adam was created, as the scripture
says, i.e., of the male and female sex, not two
different bodies but one in its essence and two in its
potentiality, for he was the earth Adamah, the red
and white [Symbol: Sulfur] the spiritual [Symbol: Gold] and [Symbol: Silver], the male and
female seed, the dust of the Adamah from Schamajim,
and therefore had the power to multiply himself
magically (just as he was celestial) which could not
indeed have been otherwise, unless the essential masculinity
and femininity were dissociated.</q> I am reminded
in this connection that Mercury is also bisexual;
the <q>materia</q> must be brought into the
androgynic state <q>rebis.</q> The idea of hermaphroditism
plays a well known, important part in mythology
also.

<p>
We have explained why phantasy creations carry
two meanings, the psychoanalytic and the anagogic,
apparently fundamentally different, even contradictory,
and yet, on account of their completeness, undeniable.
We have found that the two meanings correspond
to two aspects or two evolutionary phases
of a psychic inventory of powers, which are attached
as a unity to symbolic types, because an intro-determination
can take place in connection with the sublimation
of the impulses. When we formulated the
problem of the multiple interpretation, we were
struck with the fact that besides the two meanings
<pb n="324"/><anchor id="Pg324"/>
that were nominally antipodal in ethical relations,
there was a third ethically indifferent, namely, the
natural scientific. Apart from the fact that I have
not yet exhausted the anagogic contents of our material
and so must add a number of things in the following
sections, I am confronted with the task of
elucidating the position of the nature myth portion.
That will necessarily be done briefly.
</p>

<p>
In the case of alchemy the natural scientific content
is chemistry (in some degree connected with
physics and cosmology), a fact hardly requiring
proof. The alchemistic chemistry was not, to be
sure, scientific in the strict modern sense. In comparison
with our modern attitudes it had so much
mythical blood in it that I could call it a mythologically
apperceiving science, wherein I go a little beyond
the very clearly developed conception of Wilhelm
Wundt (Volkerps. Myth. u. Rel.) regarding
mythological apperception, from a desire for a more
rigid formulation, but without losing the peculiar
concept of the mythical or giving it the extension it
has acquired with G. F. Lipps. Alchemy's myth-like
point of view and manner of thinking is paralleled
by the fact that it was dominated by symbolic representation
and the peculiarities that go with it. [The
concept of the symbol is here to be taken, of course,
in the wider sense, as in my papers on Symbolbildung
(Jb. ps. F., II-IV).]
</p>

<p>
The choice of a symbol is strongly influenced by
what strongly impresses the mind, what moves the
soul, whether joyful or painful, what is of vital interest,
<pb n="325"/><anchor id="Pg325"/>
in short, whatever touches us nearly, whether
consciously or unconsciously. This influence is
shown even in the commonplace instances, where the
professional or the amateur is betrayed by the manner
of apperceiving one and the same object. Thus
the landscape painter sees in a lake a fine subject, the
angler an opportunity to fish, the business man a
chance to establish a sanitarium or a steamboat line,
the yachtsman a place for his pleasure trips, the heat
tormented person a chance for a bath, and the
suicide, death. In the symbolic conception of an
object, moreover (which is much more dependent
on the unconscious or uncontrolled stimulation of the
phantasy that shapes the symbol), the choice from
among the many possibilities can surely not fall upon
such images as are unsympathetic or uninteresting
to the mind. Even if we consciously make comparisons
we think of an example mostly from a favorite
and familiar sphere; when something <q>occurs</q> to
us there is already evidenced some part of an unconscious
complex. This will become elaborated in the
degree that the phantasy is given free play.
</p>

<p>
The raw product then, of the symbol-choosing
phantasy of the individual (<q>raw,</q> i.e., not covered
for publicity with a premeditated varnish) bears
traces of the things that closely concern the person
in question. (<q>Out of the fulness of the heart the
mouth speaketh</q>&mdash;even without premeditation.)
If we now start from a spiritual product which is
expressed in symbols (mythologically apperceived),
and whose author we must take to be not an individual
<pb n="326"/><anchor id="Pg326"/>
man but many generations or simply mankind,
then this product will, in the peculiarities of the selection
of the symbol, conceivably signify not individual
propensities but rather those things that affect
identically the generality of mankind. In alchemy,
which as a mythologically apperceiving science is
completely penetrated by symbols, we regard as remarkable
in the selection of symbols, the juxtaposition
of such images as reflect what we have, through
psychoanalysis, become acquainted with, as the <q>titanic</q>
impulses (Œdipus complex). No wonder!
These very impulses are the ones that we know from
psychoanalytic investigations as those which stand
above all individual idiosyncracies. And if we had
not known it, the very circumstances of alchemy
would have taught us.
</p>

<p>
The familiar scheme of impulses with its <q>titanic</q>
substratum, which is necessarily existent in
all men (although it may have been in any particular
case extraordinarily sublimated) comes clearly to
view in individual creations of fancy. It must be
found quite typically developed, however, where a
multitude of men (fable making mankind) were interested
in the founding, forming, polishing and
elaborating of the symbolic structure. Such creations
have transcended the merely personal. An
example of this kind is the <q>mythological</q> science
of alchemy. That we are repelled by the retrograde
perspective of the types residing in its symbols (and
which often appear quite nakedly) comes from the
fact that in the critic these primal impulse forms
<pb n="327"/><anchor id="Pg327"/>
have experienced a strong repression, and that their
re-emergence meets a strong resistance (morality,
taste, etc.).
</p>

<p>
The much discussed elementary types have therefore
insinuated themselves into the body of the alchemistic
hieroglyphics, as mankind, confronted with
the riddles of physico-chemical facts, struggled to
express a mastery of them by means of thought.
The typical inventory of powers, as an apperception
mass, so to speak, helped to determine the selection
of symbols. A procedure of determination has
taken place here similar to that we might have noticed
in the coincidence of material and functional
symbolism in dreams. Here again appears the
heuristic value which the introduction of the concept
of the functional categories had for our problem.
</p>

<p>
The possibility of deriving the <q>titanic</q> and the
<q>anagogic</q> from the alchemistic (often by their
authors merely chemically intended) allegories is
now easily explained. We can work it out, because
it was already put in there, even if neither in the
extreme form of the <q>titanic</q> (i.e., the retrograde
aspect), nor in that of the <q>anagogic</q> (the progressive
aspect), but in an indeterminate middle
stage of the intro-determination. What gave opportunity
for this play of symbolism was an effort of
intelligence directed toward chemistry. The chemical
content in alchemy is, so to speak, what has been
purposely striven for, while the rest came by accident,
yet none the less inevitably. So then natural
philosophy appears to be the carrier, or the stalk
<pb n="328"/><anchor id="Pg328"/>
on which the titanic and the anagogic symbolism
blossoms. Thus it becomes intelligible how the alchemistic
hieroglyphic aiming chiefly at chemistry,
adapted itself through and through to the hermetic
anagogic educational goal, so that at times and by
whole groups, alchemy was used merely as a mystical
guide without any reference to chemistry.
</p>

<p>
What we have found in alchemy we shall now
apply to mythology where analogous relations have
been indicated. [The apperception theory here used
should not be confused with the intellectual theory
(of Steinthal) which Wundt (V. Ps., IV<hi rend='vertical-align: super'>2</hi>, pp. 50 ff.)
criticised as the illusion theory. I should be more
inclined to follow closely the Wundtian conception
of the <q>mythological apperception</q> (ibid., pp. 64
ff.) with particular emphasis on the affective elements
that are to work there. With Wundt, the affects
are really the <q>actual impulse mainsprings</q> and
the most powerful stimuli of the phantasy (ib., p.
60). <q>The affects of fear and hope, wish and desire,
love and hate, are the widely disseminated
sources of the myth. They are, of course, continually
linked with images. But they are the ones that
first breathe life into these images.</q> I differ from
Wundt in that I have more definite ideas of the
origin of these affects, by which they are brought
into close connection with the frequently mentioned
elementary motives.] Modern investigation of
myths has, in my opinion, sufficiently shown that we
are here concerned with a nucleus of natural philosophy
(comprehension of astral and even of meteorological
<pb n="329"/><anchor id="Pg329"/>
processes, etc.) around which legendary and
historical material can grow. As has been shown
by two fairy tales and as I could have abundantly
shown from countless others, the psychoanalytic and
the anagogic interpretations are possible alongside
of the scientific. [We can criticise Hitchcock for
having in his explanations of fairy tales considered
them only in their most developed form, and not
bothered about their origin and archaic forms. And
as a matter of fact the more developed forms permit
a very much richer anagogic interpretation than the
archaic. But that is no proof against the interpretation,
but only establishes their orientation in the
development of the human spirit. The anagogic
interpretation is indeed a prospective explanation in
the sense of an ethical advance. Now the evolution
even of fairy tales shows quite clearly a progression
towards the ethical; and inasmuch as the ethical content
of the tale grows by virtue of this evolution,
the anagogic explanation is in the nature of things
able to place itself in higher developed tales in correspondingly
closer connection with mythical material.]
I adduce here only one example, namely the
schema that Frobenius has derived from the comparison
of numerous sun myths. The hero is swallowed
by a water monster in the west [the sun sets
in the sea]. The animal journeys with him to the
east (night path of the sun apparently under the
sea). He lights a fire in the belly of the animal and
cuts off a piece of the pendant heart when he feels
hungry. Soon after he notices that the fish is running
<pb n="330"/><anchor id="Pg330"/>
aground. (The reillumined sun comes up to
the horizon from below.) He begins immediately
to cut his way out of the animal, and then slips out
(sunrise). In the belly of the fish it has become so
hot that all his hair has fallen out. (Hair probably
signifies rays.) Quite as clear as the nature
myth purport, is the fact that we have a representation
of regeneration, which is quite as conceivable in
psychoanalytic as in anagogic explanation.
</p>

<p>
Now I cannot approve of the attempt of many
psychoanalysts to treat as a negligible quantity or
to ignore altogether the scientific content (nature
nucleus) of the myths which has been so well substantiated
by the newer research, even though it is
not so well established in the details. [I have uttered
a similar warning in Jb. ps. F., IV (Princip.
Anreg.) and previously, in Jb. ps. F., II (Phant. u.
Myth), have advocated the equality of the natural
philosophical and the psychological content. Now I
observe with pleasure that very recently an author
of the psychoanalytic school is engaged on the very
subject that I have recommended as so desirable.
Dr. Emil F. Lorenz, in the February number of
<hi rend='italic'>Imago</hi>, 1913, treats the <q>Titan Motiv in der allgemeinen
Mythologie</q> in a manner that approaches
my conception of it. In the consideration of human
primal motives as apperception mass, there is particularly
revealed a common thought in the primitive
interpretation of natural phenomenon. Unfortunately
the article appeared after this book was finished.
So even if I am not in a position to enter
<pb n="331"/><anchor id="Pg331"/>
into this question, I will none the less refer to it
and at the same time express the hope that Lorenz
will further elaborate the interesting preliminary
contribution, communicated in the form of aphorisms,
as he terms it.] The inadmissibility of these
omissions arises from the vital importance and gripping
effect of the objects thus (i.e., mythologically)
regarded by humanity (e.g., of the course of the sun,
so infinitely important for them in their dependence
upon the moods of nature). If then, on the one
hand, it will not be possible for the psychoanalyst to
force the nature mythologist out of his position and
somehow to prove that any symbol means not the sun
but the father, so on the other hand the nature
mythologist who may understand his own interpretations
so admirably, must not attack the specifically
psychological question: why in the apperception of
an object, this and not that symbolic image offers itself
to consciousness. So, for instance, why the sunset
and sunrise is so readily conceived as a swallowing
and eructation, or as a process of regeneration.
Yet Frobenius (Zeitalt. d. Sonneng., I, p. 30) finds
the symbolism <q>negligible.</q>
</p>

<p>
It is also conceivable that the obtrusive occurrence
of incest, castration of the father, etc., should
make the mythologists ponder. It was bias on the
part of many of them to be unwilling to see the psychological
value of these things. I must therefore
acknowledge the justice of Rank's view when he
(Inz-Mot., p. 278) says in reference to the Œdipus
myth (rightly, in all probability, interpreted by
<pb n="332"/><anchor id="Pg332"/>
Goldziher as a sun myth): <q>Yet it is indubitable
that these ideas of incest with the mother and the
murder of the father are derived from human life,
and that the myth in this human disguise could never
be brought down from heaven without a corresponding
psychic idea, which may really have been an unconscious
one even at the time of the formation of
the myth, just as it is with the mythologists of today.</q>
</p>

<p>
And in another passage (pp. 318 ff.): <q>While
these investigators (astral and moon mythologists)
would consider incest and castration operative in an
equal or even greater degree than we do, as the
chief motives in the formation of myths in the celestial
examples only, we are forced by psychoanalytical
considerations to find in them universal primitive
human purposes which later, as a result of the
need of psychological justification, have been projected
into the heavens from which our myth interpreters
wish in turn to derive them. [Whether such
a need of justification has had a share in the formation
of myths appears to me doubtful or at any rate
not demonstrable. At all events in so strongly emphasizing
these unnecessary assumptions and conceiving
the projection upon heaven of the mundane psychological
primal motives as an act of release, we
hide the more important cause for concerning ourselves
with heaven, namely the already mentioned
vital importance of the things that are accomplished
there. Now the fact that the primal motives cooperate
in the symbolical realization of these things,
<pb n="333"/><anchor id="Pg333"/>
implies no defense directed against them. A better
defense would be to repress them in symbolism than,
as really happens, to utilize them in it.] These interpreters,
for example, have believed that they
recognized in the motive of dismemberment (castration)
a symbolic suggestion of the gradual
waning of the moon, while the reverse is for us undoubted,
namely, that the offensive castration has
found a later symbolization in the moon phases.
Yet it argues either against all logic and psychology,
or for our conception of the sexualization of the universe,
that man should have symbolized so harmless
a phenomenon as the changes of the moon, by so
offensive a one as the dismemberment or castration
of the nearest relative. So the nature mythologists
also, and Siecke in particular, have thought that
primitive man has <q>immediately regarded</q> the (to
him) incomprehensible waning of the moon as a dismemberment,
while this is psychologically quite unthinkable
unless this image, which is taken from
earthly life, should have likewise originated in
human life and thought (phantasy).</q>
</p>

<p>
It is indeed never conceivable that men would have
chosen for the natural phenomenon exactly these
titanic symbols, if these had not had for them a special
psychic value, and therefore touched them
closely. If any one should object that they would
not have <q>chosen</q> them (because they did not purposely
invent allegories, as was formerly thought),
I should raise the contrary question: Who has chosen
them? I will stick to the word <q>choose</q> for a
<pb n="334"/><anchor id="Pg334"/>
choice has taken place. But the powers that arranged
this choice lived and still live in the soul of
man.
</p>

<p>
The conception advocated by me gives their due
to the nature mythologists just as much as to the
psychologists that oppose them. It reinstates, moreover,
a third apparently out-worn tendency [the so-called
degeneration theory] that sees in the myth the
veiling of ancient priestly wisdom. This obsolete
view had the distinction that it placed some value,
which the modern interpreters did not, on the anagogic
content of the myths (even if in a wrong perspective).
The necessity of reckoning with an anagogic
content of myths results from the fact that
religions with their ethical valuations, have developed
from mythical beginnings. And account must
be taken of these relations. In the way in which
the older interpretations of myths regarded the connection,
they pursued a phantom, but their point of
view becomes serviceable as soon as it reverses the
order of evolution. It is not true that the religious
content in myths was the priestly wisdom of antiquity,
but rather that it became such at the end of
the development. My conception shows further
that the utmost significance for the recognition and
comparison of the motives (corresponding to the
psychological types) attaches to the material so brilliantly
reconstructed by Stucken and other modern
investigators, but not the convincing evidence
which some think they find there for the migration
<pb n="335"/><anchor id="Pg335"/>
theory, as against the theory of elementary
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the possibly repellent impression
derived from the notion of an unconscious thought
activity of the myth forming phantasy, I should like
to close with these words of Karl Otfried Müller:
<q>It is possible that the concept of unconsciousness in
the formation of myths will appear obscure to many,
even mysterious ... but is history not to acknowledge
the strange also, when unprejudiced investigation
leads to it?</q>

<head>The Goal Of The Work.</head>

<p>
In the preceding section the symbolism and the
psychology of the progress of the mystic work has
been developed more or less, but certainly not to
the end. Regeneration is evidently the beginning
of a new development, the nature of which we have
not yet closely examined. Nothing has yet been said
definitely about the later phases of the work and
about its goal. I am afraid that this section, although
it is devoted chiefly to the goal of the work,
cannot elucidate it with anything like the clearness
that would be desirable. To be sure the final outcome
of the work can be summed up in the three
words: Union with God. Yet we cannot possibly
rest satisfied with a statement that is for our psychological
needs so vague; we must endeavor to comprehend
the intimate nature of the spiritual experiences
that we have on the journey into the unsearchable;
although I must at the outset point out that at
every step by which the symbolism of the mystics
leads us towards regeneration, we run the risk of
wandering away from psychology, and that in the
following we shall all too soon experience these deviations.
We shall have to transplant ourselves uncritically
<pb n="337"/><anchor id="Pg337"/>
at times, into the perceptual world of the
hermetics, which is, of course, a mere fiction, for in
order to do it rightly we should have to have a
mystical development behind us [whatever this may
be]; one would have to be himself a <q>twice born.</q>
One thing can be accepted as true, that a series of
symbols that occur with striking agreement among
all mystics of all times and nations is related to a
variety of experiences which evidently are common
to all mystics in different degrees of their development,
but are foreign to the non-mystics (or more
exactly to all men, even mystics, who have not attained
the given level).
</p>

<p>
With this premise I will take up the question of
the goal of alchemy (mysticism). In this I follow
in general the train of thought of Hitchcock, without
adhering closely to his exposition. (I cite H. A.
= Hitchcock, Remarks upon Alchemy.)
</p>

<p>
The alchemistic process is, as the hermetics
themselves say, a cyclical work, and the end resides
to a certain degree in the beginning. Here lies one
of the greatest mysteries of the whole of alchemy,
although the meaning of the language is to be understood
more or less as follows. If, for example, it
is said that whoever wishes to make gold must have
gold, we must suppose that the seeker of truth must
<hi rend='italic'>be</hi> true (H. A., p. 67); that whoever desires to live
in harmony with the conscience must be in harmony
with it, and that whoever will go the way to God,
must already have God in himself. Now when the
conscience, wherein the sense of right and justice has
<pb n="338"/><anchor id="Pg338"/>
existence, becomes active under the idea of God, it
is endowed with supernatural force and is then, as
I understand it, the alchemists' philosophical mercury
and his valued salt of mercury. It is no less
his sovereign treacle, etc. (H. A., p. 53). The
progress of the work points to some kind of unity
as the goal which, however, very few men attain
except in words (H. A., p. 157). The hermetic
writers set up the claim to a complete agreement in
their teachings, but this agreement is restricted to
some principles of vital significance in their doctrine,
which have reference almost exclusively to a definite
practice; probably to a complete setting to work of
the consciousness of duty, which is what Kant claims
to do with his categorical imperative: <q>An unreasoning,
though not unreasonable, obedience to an
experienced, imperious sense of duty, leaving the result
to God; and this I am disposed to call the Way.</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l rend='margin-left: 4'>Do thy duty!</l>
<l>Ask not after the result of thy doing!</l>
<l>Without dependence thereon carry out that which is thy duty!</l>
<l>Whoever acts without attachment to the world, that man attains the loftiest goal.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
And the like in many places in the Bhagavad-Gita.
</p>

<p>
Now the end is perhaps the fruit of this obedience.
It may be that the steady preservation of
the inward unity, which regards with composure all
external vicissitudes, leads man finally to some special
experience, by which a seal of confirmation is set
<pb n="339"/><anchor id="Pg339"/>
upon what was first a mere trust in the ultimate blessing
of rectitude (H. A., p. 128). The hermetic
philosophers would have the conscience known as the
Way or as the base of the work, but with regard to
the peculiar wonder work of alchemy (transmutation)
they place the chief value on love; it effects
the transformation of the <emph>subject</emph> into the <emph>object</emph>
loved (H. A., p. 132).
</p>

<p>
Arabi: <q>It is a fundamental principle of love
that thou becomest the real essence of the beloved
(God) in that thou givest up thy individuality and
disappearest in him. Blessedness is the abiding
place of the divine and holy joy.</q> (Horten, Myst.,
I, p. 9.)
</p>

<p>
Similarly we find in the yoga primers that the
spirit, by sinking into an object of perception, becomes
identical with the object. The object need
not be the very highest, but a gradation is possible.
Arabi, too, recognizes a gradation of objects, as they
correspond, as correlates of sinking or surrender, to
the different mystical states. [Colors, etc., of alchemy.]
Two passages of Arabi may be quoted:
<q>My heart is eligible for every form [of the religious
cult]; for it is said that the heart (root: kalaba
= overturn, to alter oneself) is so called from its
continual changing.</q> It changes in accordance with
the various (divine) influences that it feels, according
to the various states of the mystical illumination.
This variation of experiences is a result of the variation
of the divine appearances, which occur in its
inmost spirit. The law of religion (theology)
<pb n="340"/><anchor id="Pg340"/>
speaks of this phenomenon as the changing and
metamorphizing in the forms (of living and being).
Gazelles are the objects of the mystic's love. In
one of his poems he says: <q>And surrender yourselves
to play in the manner of lovely maidens with
buxom breasts and enjoy the luxuriant willows in the
manner of the female gazelles.</q> In his commentary
on this passage he says: <q><q>Play</q> denotes the various
states of the mystic, to which he is advanced
when he passes from one divine name to another.</q>
(Horten, Myst., I, pp. 11, 13, ff.)
</p>

<p>
It is the ethical ideal of the mystic, more and
more to put off the limited ego, and to take on in its
place the qualities of God, in order to become God.
</p>

<p>
When with Arabi the theme of an ode is
<q>Through asceticism, fervent yearning after God
and patience in suffering, man becomes God or acquires
divine nature</q> (Horten, Myst., I, p. 16),
then this goal is identical with that of the alchemistic
transmutation; the base metal acquires (after
purification, refining, etc.) by virtue of the tincturing
with the Philosopher's Stone the nature of gold, i.e.,
the divine nature.
</p>

<p>
But patient effort is requisite. Precipitancy is as
great an evil as inactivity. It is, to use the language
of the alchemists, just as bad to scorch the
tender blossoms by a forced and hasty fire (that in
spite of its intensity may be merely a straw fire), as
to let go out the fire which should be continuously
kept alight, and to let grow cold the materia. The
process of distillation is to be accomplished slowly,
<pb n="341"/><anchor id="Pg341"/>
so that the spirits may not escape. That which rises
as steam through the <q>heating</q> in the <q>receptacle</q>
(i.e., in man) is the soul rising into the higher
regions. Distilling like rain drops [destillare = drop
down], it brings each time to the thirsting
materia a divine gain. But this process is not to be
overdone, for the thirsting earth must be gently instilled
with the heavenly moisture of the water of
life: the process of <q>imbibition.</q>
</p>

<p>
The metallic subject must be gently dissolved in
its own natural water (conscience), not with powerful
media, not with corroding acids, which the foolish
employ in order to reach the goal in a hurry, for
by such means he either spoils the materia or produces
a merely superficial action. Senseless asceticism
and the like are just as objectionable as the impetuous
enthusiasm (which we called straw fire
here). The ethical work of alchemy as of common
life is a sublimation; it is important that the
materia takes up at any time only as much as it can
sublimate. We may also conceive it in this way.
The materia is to be moistened only with the water
that it can utilize after the solution has taken place
(i.e., keep in enduring form, absorb into their nature).
Compare in this connection the words of
Count Bernhard von Trevis: <q>I tell you assuredly
that no water dissolves any metallic spices by a natural
solution, save that which abides with them in
matter and form, and which the metals themselves,
being dissolved, can recongeal.</q> (H. A., pp. 189
ff.)
</p>

<pb n="342"/><anchor id="Pg342"/>

<p>
The passage <q>slowly and quite judiciously</q> of
the Smaragdine tablet will now be fully appreciated.
</p>

<p>
The desired completion or oneness should be a
state of the soul, a condition of being, not of knowing.
The means that lead to it presuppose in the
neophyte something analogous to religious faith, and
because the conditions of the mastery appear to the
neophyte to contradict nature or each other, the mystical
experiences that are derived from it are called
<q>supernatural.</q> The <q>supernatural</q> is, however,
only an appearance, which results when we conceive
nature too narrowly, as when we see in her merely
the totality of bodies. If we mean by nature the
possibility of life and activity, then that which appears
supernatural must be counted as nature. The
expressions natural and supernatural are but means
of the thinking judgment, they are preliminaries
which have a certain justification but only so long as
they are an expression for a stage of knowledge.
The initially supernatural resolves itself in nature,
or better, Nature is raised to divinity. If the natural
and the supernatural are symbolized, the one
being described as sulphur and the other as mercury,
then the disciples of philosophy, under the obligation
to think things and not merely names, are finally
brought, during the process of search, to a recognition
of the inseparableness of both in a third something
which may be called sun; but as all three are
recognized as inseparably one, the termini can
change places until finally an inner illumination takes
place. <q>Those that have never had this experience
<pb n="343"/><anchor id="Pg343"/>
are apt to decry it as imaginary, but those who enter
into it know that they have entered into a higher
life, or feel themselves enabled to look upon things
from a higher point of view. To use what may seem
to be a misapplication of language: it is a supernatural
birth, naturally entered upon.</q> (H. A., p.
229.) When the alchemists speak of philosophical
mercury and philosophical gold, they mean something
in man and something in God that finally turns
out to be the One. <q>By this symbolism the alchemists
escape the difficulty of treating the subject in
ordinary language. The learner must always return
to nature and her possibilities for the sense of the
derived symbols, and to it the hermetic masters also
continually direct him.</q> (H. A., pp. 232 ff.) If
the true light has risen in the hearts of the seekers,
kindled from within (although apparently by a miracle
from without) <q>the sulphur and mercury become
one, or are seen to be the same, differing only in a
certain relation; somewhat as the known and the
unknown (and the conscious and the unconscious)
are but one, the unknown decreasing as the known
increases, and vice versa.</q> (H. A., p. 235.)
</p>

<p>
One alchemist teaches: <q>Consider well what it
is you desire to produce, and according to that regulate
your intention. Take the last thing in your
intention as the first thing in your principles....
Attempt nothing out of its own nature [then follow
parables that grapes are not gathered from thistles,
etc.]. If you know how to apply this doctrine in
your operation as you ought, you will find great benefit,
<pb n="344"/><anchor id="Pg344"/>
and a door will hereby be opened to the discovery
of greater mysteries.</q> Actually there is a greater
difference between one who seeks what he seeks as
an end, and one who seeks it as a means to an end.
To seek knowledge for riches is a very different
thing from seeking riches (or independence) as an
instrument of knowledge. In the study in question
the means and the end must coincide, i.e., the truth
must be sought for itself only. (H. A., p. 238.)
In the book, <q>De Manna Benedicto,</q> we read:
<q>Whoever thou art that readest this tractate, let
me exhort thee that thou directest thy understanding
and soul more toward God for the keeping of his
commandments, than toward love of this art [sc. its
external portions], for although it be the only, indeed
the whole wisdom of the world, it is yet powerless
in comparison with the divine wisdom of the soul,
which is the love towards God, in the keeping of his
commandments.... Hast thou been covetous, profane
one? Be thou meek and pious and serve in all
lowliness the glorious creator; if thou art not determined
to do that, thou art employed in trying to
wash an Ethiop white.</q>
</p>

<p>
Desire is, as some ancient philosophers think, the
root of all affects, which manifest themselves in
pairs. Joy corresponds to desire fulfilled, sorrow
to the obstructed or imperiled fulfillment; hope is
the expectation of fulfillment, fear the opposite, etc.
All the pairs of opposites are in some degree superficial,
something that comes and goes with time, while
the essential remains, itself invisible and without relation
<pb n="345"/><anchor id="Pg345"/>
to time&mdash;a perpetual activity, an ever enduring
conation as it was formerly called. (It is the
libido of the psychoanalysis. In its manifestations
it is subjected to bipolarity, as Stekel has named the
inevitable pairs of opposites.)
</p>

<p>
The pairs of opposites have been noticed in the
Hindu doctrine of salvation exactly as in alchemy.
Alchemistic hieroglyphics we know are rich in [ambiguous]
expressions for a hostile Dyas (couple),
with whose removal a better condition first commences,
although at the outset it is actually requisite
for the achievement of the work. In the Bhagavad-Gita
the pairs of opposites play a great part. The
world is full of agony on account of the pairs of
opposites, which are to be found everywhere. Heat,
cold; high, low; good, evil; joy, sorrow; poor, rich;
young, old; etc. The basis of the opposites is
formed by the primal opposition Rajas-Tamas. To
escape from it in recognizing the true ego as superior
to it and not participating in it, is the foremost
purpose of the effort toward salvation. So whoever
has raised himself above the qualities of substances
is described as having escaped from opposites.

Hermes on the human soul: <q>The accidents residing
in the material substances have never sympathized
with each other, but on the contrary have
always been in opposition and in mutual conflict.
Guard thyself O soul from them and turn away
from them.... Thou O soul art of one nature,
but they are manifold; thou art but one with thyself;
they are, however, in conflict with each other.
[Psychoanalytically regarded, to the soul is here assigned
the property which is desired but is not present,
while that which is undesired but actually present
in the soul (inclination and disinclination) is projected
into the external world.] ... How long O
soul wilt thou yet be needy, and flee from every sensation
to its opposite, now from warmth to cold, now
from cold to warmth, now from hunger to satiety,
now from satiety to hunger?</q> (Fleischer Herm.
a. d. Seele, pp. 14 ff.) <q>Be thou O soul regardful
<pb n="347"/><anchor id="Pg347"/>
of the behavior in this world, yet not as a child without
understanding who when one gives him to eat
and acts leniently towards him is satisfied and cheerful,
but when one treats him severely cries and is
bad, indeed begins to weep while laughing and when
he is satisfied begins again to be bad. This is not
worthy of approbation but rather a mongrel and
blameworthy behavior. The world O soul, is so
organized as to unify exactly these opposites; good
and evil, weal and woe, distress and comfort, and
contains types of ideas that have the effect of waking
the soul and making it aware of itself, so that as a
result it gains reason that illumines and consummates
knowledge, i.e., wisdom and knowledge of the true
nature of things. For this purpose alone has the
soul come into the world, to learn and experience;
but it is like a man that comes to a place to become
acquainted with it and know its conditions, but then
gives up the learning, inquiring and collecting of information,
and diverts his spirit by reaching after
luxury and the enjoyment of other things, and in so
doing forgets to acquire that which he was to strive
for.</q> (L. c., pp. 8 ff.)
</p>

<p>
I return to the psychological point of view of our
friend Hitchcock: <q>Desire and love are almost
synonymous terms, for we love and seek what we
desire, and so also we desire and seek what we love;
yet neither love nor desire is by any necessary connection
directed to one thing rather than another,
but either under conditions suitable to it may be directed
to anything. From which it follows that it
<pb n="348"/><anchor id="Pg348"/>
is possible to make God as the Eternal, its object, or
call it truth and we may see that its enjoyment must
partake of its own nature. Now we read that it is
not common for man to love and pursue the good
and the true because it is the good and true; but we
call that good which we desire and there lies the
great mistake of life. From all which we may see
that vast consequences follow from the choice of an
object of desire, which as we have said, may as easily
be an eternal as a transient one. We should be on
guard against a too mechanical conception of these
things. By so doing we should depart too greatly
from the point of view of the true alchemists. One
author tells of the significant advance that he made
from the time when he discovered that nature works
<q>magically.</q></q> (H. A., Hitchcock's Remarks upon
Alchemy, pp. 294 ff.)
</p>

<p>
Aversion and hate, the opposites of desire and
love, are not independent affections but depend upon
the latter. There is only the one impulsion of demand
that strives for what satisfies it and repulses
what conflicts with it. <q>If then desire is turned to
one only eternal thing, then, since the nature of man
takes its character from his leading or chief desire,
the whole man is gradually converted to, or, as some
think, transmuted into that one thing.</q> (H. A.,
pp. 295 ff.)
</p>

<p>
The doctrine naturally presupposes the possibility,
already mentioned, of a schooling of the will, yet it
will still be necessary to fix it upon a definite object.
The love of the transitory finds itself deceived because
<pb n="349"/><anchor id="Pg349"/>
the objects vanish, while the desire itself, the
conation (or in psychoanalytic language the libido),
continues forever. For this everlasting desire only
an everlasting object is suitable. An object of that
kind is not to be found in the external world. We
can only withdraw the outer object and offer ideals
in exchange. The moment that this withdrawal of
external objects takes place the libido begins, as it
were, to eject itself as an object; in the ideal we give
it a nucleus for this process, in order that it may
form the new object around it and water it with its
own life. So in a <q>magic</q> way a new world is
formed whose laws are those of the ideal. The
formation of the new world (new earth and new
heaven, new Jerusalem, etc.) occurs frequently in the
symbolic language of mysticism.
</p>

<p>
The laws of the ideal and consequently of the new
world are determined by the nature of the ideal.
Not every one is proved everlastingly suitable.

<p>
says the Highest Being to Arjuna in the Bhagavad-Gita
(IX, 25). The mystic is in the position from
the moment of regeneration, to create in himself a
new world with laws that he may, to a certain extent,
himself select. Fortunate is he who makes a good
selection. Every one is the architect of his own fortune.
This is most true when after introversion the
<pb n="350"/><anchor id="Pg350"/>
power of self determining one's own destiny is directed
toward the most intensive living. The formation
and cultivation of the new earth is a beginning
that is rich with significant consequences. The
alchemists speak of a maidenly earth or a flaky
white earth (i.e., crystalline) as a certain stage in
the work. This is probably the stage that we are
examining now, the stage of the new, still undeveloped
earth that is now to be organized (according
to the conceived ideal). The soil is crystalline because
the old earth was dissolved and has been
freshly formed from the solution. The crystallization
corresponds to regeneration. The <q>white
earth</q> probably corresponds to the <q>white stone,</q>
which is the first stage of completion after the blacks
(first mystical death, putrefaction, trituration, or
contrition). In the white earth a seed is sown.
We shall hear of it later.
</p>

<p>
If the work is not to make men unserviceable and
is not again to bring them into conflict with the demands
of life, so that all the effort would have been
fruitless, the new world must be organized in such
a way that it is compatible with the demands of real
life. In other words, the ideal that regulates the
new world must be an ethical one. The mystic who
wishes to be freed from contradictions will have to
follow his conscience as a guide, and not the unexplored
but the explored conscience. He cannot escape
it in the long run (the magicians that defy it
are, as the legend informs us, finally torn to pieces
by the devil); it is better for him to get upon its
<pb n="351"/><anchor id="Pg351"/>
side and so turn the conflict in his favor. It appears
that this manly attitude would have a marvelous
inner concord as a result and outwardly, a remarkable
firmness of character. It is not my object to
decide what metaphysical significance the strengthening
through mysticism of the ideal (God in me)
may have.

<p>
<q>Take, O soul, not the unworthy and common as
a model, for such use and word will adhere to thee
finally as a nature opposed to thine own. By this
means, however, the strong impulse itself towards
union with thy nature and to the return into thy
home goes astray. Know that the exalted and majestic
Originator of things, is himself the noblest of
all things. Take then the noble things as a model,
in order by that means to get nearer thy Creator on
the path of elective affinity. And know that the
noble attaches itself to the noble and the vulgar to
the common.</q> (Fleischer, Herm. a. d. Seele, p.

What is to be sown in the new earth is generally
called love. A crop of love is to arise; with love
will the new world be saturated; its laws will be the
laws of love. By love a transmutation of the subject
is to take place. One alchemist (quoted in
H. A., pp. 133 ff.) writes as follows:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I find the nature of Divine Love to be a perfect
unity and simplicity. There is nothing more one,
undivided, simple, pure, unmixed and uncompounded
than Love....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In the second place I find Love to be the most
<pb n="352"/><anchor id="Pg352"/>
perfect and absolute liberty. Nothing can move
Love, but Love; nothing touch Love, but Love; nor
nothing constrain Love, but Love. It is free from
all things; itself only gives laws to itself, and those
laws are the laws of Liberty; for nothing acts more
freely than Love, because it always acts from itself,
and is moved by itself, by which prerogatives Love
shows itself to be allied to the Divine Nature, yea,
to be God himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Thirdly, Love is all strength and power. Make
a diligent search through Heaven and Earth, and you
will find nothing so powerful as Love. What is
stronger than Hell and Death? Yet Love is the
triumphant conqueror of both. What more formidable
than the wrath of God? Yet Love overcomes
it, and dissolves and changes it into itself.
In a word, nothing can withstand the prevailing
strength of Love: it is the strength of Mount Zion,
which can never be moved.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the fourth place: Love is of a transmuting
and transforming nature. The great effect of Love
is to turn all things into its own nature, which is all
goodness, sweetness, and perfection. This is that
Divine power which turns water into wine; sorrow
and anguish into exulting and triumphant joy; and
curses into blessings. Where it meets with a barren
and heathy desert, it transmutes it into a paradise
of delights; yea, it changeth evil into good, and
all imperfection into perfection. It restores that
which is fallen and degenerated to its primary beauty,
excellence and perfection. It is the Divine Stone,
<pb n="353"/><anchor id="Pg353"/>
the White Stone with the name written upon it, which
no one knows but he that hath it. [Cf. Rev. II, 17.
<q>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh
will I give to eat [nutritio] of the hidden manna,
and will give him a white stone, and in the stone
a new name written, which no man knoweth saving
he that receiveth it.</q> Also III, 12: <q>Him that
overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple
of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will
write upon him the name of my God, and the name
of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem,
which cometh down out of heaven from my God:
and I will write upon him my new name.</q> Cf. also
XIX, 12, and XXI, 2. The White Stone with the new
name is also joined with the new earth. Because of
this it is important that the new Jerusalem is <q>prepared
as a bride adorned for her husband.</q>] In a
word, it is the Divine Nature, it is God himself,
whose essential property it is to assimilate all things
with himself; or [if you will have it in the scripture
phrase] to reconcile all things to himself, whether
they be in Heaven or in Earth; and all by means of
this Divine Elixir, whose transforming power and
efficacy nothing can withstand....</q> (H. A., pp.
133 ff.)
</p>

<p>
At the end of the work there ensues the union of
sun and moon, typifying God and man. As in the
Vedanta the teaching of the holy books of India, the
Upanishads, so in alchemy, the difference between
the one soul and the All Soul is of no importance.
<pb n="354"/><anchor id="Pg354"/>
For every one who succeeds in overcoming the fundamental
error, in which we are all implicated, the
difference vanishes, and the two things previously
separated coalesce. In reality there is only the one
thing: God.
</p>

<p>
Irenæus writes: <q rend='pre'>... The fire of nature assimilates
all that it nourishes to its own likeness, and
then our mercury or menstruum vanishes, that is, it
is swallowed by the solar nature [The soul of man
dissolves and is taken up by the divine or All Soul]
and all together make but one universal mercury
[All Soul] by intimate union. And this mercury is
the material principle of the Stone; for formerly,
when it was compounded of three mercuries,
[namely, when they thought they had to distinguish
spirit, soul and body, or some other division in it]
then Soul, world and God were, for example, to be
thought of, or as they are called in Soeta-svatara-Upanishad
V, Enjoyer, Object of Enjoyment, and
Inciter.</q>

</lg>
</quote>

<p>
Cf. also Deussen, Syst. d. Ved., p. 232, and Sutr.
d. Ved., pp. 541 ff.: <q>Frequently we are told of
the connection of the highest with the individual
soul, and then again of a splitting up [conditioned by
them] inside the Brahma, by virtue of which their
two parts are mutually opposed and limited. Both
of these things happen, however, only from the
<pb n="355"/><anchor id="Pg355"/>
standpoint of the distinctions [upadhi]....
There were two which were superficial (in that they
formed an unjustified opposition) and the third essential
to Sol and Luna only, not to the Stone; for
nature would produce these two out of it by artificial
decoction.... [These distinctions depend on
ignorance, after throwing off which the individual is
one with the highest. The connection of the individual
soul with Brahman is in truth its entering
into its own self, and the division in Brahma is as
unreal as that between space in general and space
within the body.] But when the two perfect bodies
are dissolved [prepared for the mystical work] they
are transmuted with the mercury that dissolved them,
and then there is no more repugnancy in it; then
there is no longer a distinction between superficial
and essential. And this is that one matter of the
stone, that one thing which is the subject of all wonders.
When thou art come to this then shalt thou
no more discern a distinction between the Dissolver
[God] and the dissolved [soul] ... and the color
of the ripe sulphur [the divine nature] inseparably
united to it will tinge your water [soul].</q> Irenæus
says that the two bodies, Sol and Luna, are compared
by the alchemists to two mountains, first because
they are found in mountains, and second by
way of opposition: <q>For where mountains are
highest above ground, there they lie deepest underground,</q>
and he adds: <q>The name is not of so
much consequence, take the body which is gold [i.e.,
here the consummate man] and throw it into mercury,
<pb n="356"/><anchor id="Pg356"/>
such a mercury as is bottomless [infinite], that
is, whose center it can never find but by discovering
its own.</q> (H. A., 283 ff.)
</p>

<p>
In reference to these and similar expressions of
the alchemists, Hitchcock rightly calls our attention
to Plotinus, who writes, for example (Enn., VI, 9,
10): <q>We must comprehend God with our whole
being, so that we no longer have in us a single part
that is not dependent upon God. Then we may
see him and ourselves as it beseems us to see, in radiant
beams, filled with spiritual light, or rather as
pure light itself [notice this fullness of light] without
weight, imponderable, become God or rather
being God. Our life's flame is then kindled; but if
we sink down into the world of sense, it is as if extinguished....
Whoever has thus seen himself
will, then, when he looks, see himself as one who has
become unified, or rather he will be united to himself
as such a one and feel himself as such. Possibly
one should not in this case speak of seeing.
But as regards the seen, if we can indeed distinguish
the seeing and the seen, and not rather have to describe
both as one, which is, to be sure, a bold statement,
then the seeing really does not see in this condition,
nor does he differentiate two things, nor has
he the idea of two things. He is, as it were, another;
he ceases to be himself, he belongs no longer
to himself; arriving there, he has ascended unto God
and has become one with him, as a center that coincides
with another center; the two coinciding things
are here one, and only two when they are separated.
<pb n="357"/><anchor id="Pg357"/>
In this sense we speak of the soul's being another
than God.</q>
</p>

<p>
I recall also the passage in Amor Proximi where
it is said that the earth will again be placed in
Solis punctum. The center of the sun [God] is to
be seen in the symbol [Symbol: Gold]. We now understand the
mystical difference between the hieroglyphs [Symbol: Gold] and
[Symbol: Alum], between gold and alum. In order to express in
the mercury symbol [Symbol: Mercury] the accomplished union (represented
by +) of [Symbol: Gold] and [Symbol: Silver], which takes place
through the newly discovered central point, the symbol
[Symbol: Mercury] is also used.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned the vedantic teachings, whose
agreement with alchemy has also been noticed by
Hitchcock. It takes emphatically the point of view
of the <q>non-existence of a second.</q> Multiplicity is
appearance; the difference between the individual
soul and the All Soul depends upon an error which
we can overcome. The goal of salvation is the
ascent into the universal spirit Brahma (in the nirvana
of the Buddhists there is the same thought).
Whoever has entered into the highest spirit, there
is no longer any <q>other</q> for him. Brhadaranyaka-Upanishad,
IV, 3: (23) <q>If he does not then
[The man in the deep sleep (susupti),] see, he is
yet seeing although he sees not, for there is no interruption
of vision for the seeing, because he is imperishable;
but there is no second beside him, no
other different from him that he could see. (24.)
If he does not smell, he is yet smelling although he
smells not, for there is for the smelling [person] no
<pb n="358"/><anchor id="Pg358"/>
interruption of smelling because he is imperishable;
but there is no second thing beside him, no other
thing different from him that he could smell....
(32.) He stands like water [i.e., so pure] seer
alone and without a second ... he whose world is
Brahm. This is his highest goal, this is his highest
fortune, this is his highest world, this is his
highest joy; through a minute particle of only this
joy the other creatures have their life.</q>
</p>

<p>
If I compare the hermetic teachings on the one
hand with the vedanta, and on the other with the
Samkhya-Yoga, I do not lose sight of the fundamental
antagonism of both&mdash;Vedanta is monistic,
Samkhya is dualistic&mdash;but in appreciation of the
doctrine of salvation which is common to both.
That the mystic finds the same germ in both systems
is shown by the Bhagavad-Gita. For him the theoretical
difference is trivial, whether the materia is
dissolved as mere illusion, when he has attained his
mystic goal, or whether, as an eternal substance, it
is as something overcome, simply withdrawn, never
more to be seen. According to the Samkhya doctrine,
too, the saved soul enters into its own being,
and every connection with objects of knowledge
ceases.
</p>

<p>
In Yogavasistha it is written: <q>So serene as
would the light appear if all that is illumined, i.e.,
space, earth, ether, did not exist, such is the isolated
state of the seer, of the pure self, when the threefold
world, you and I, in brief, all that is visible, is gone.
As the state of a mirror is, in which no reflection
<pb n="359"/><anchor id="Pg359"/>
falls, neither of statues nor of anything else&mdash;only
representing in itself the being [of the mirror]&mdash;such
is the isolation of the seer, who remains without
seeing, after the jumble of phenomena, I, you, the
world, etc., has vanished.</q> (Garbe, Samkhya-Phil.,
p. 326.)
</p>

<p>
In the materia (prakri) of the Samkhya system reside
the three qualities or constituents already familiar
to us, Rajas, Tamas, and Sattva. Whoever
unmasks these as the play of qualities, raises himself
above the world impulses. For him, as he is freed
from antagonisms, the play ceases. When a soul
is satiated with the activity of matter and turns away
from it with disdain, then matter ceases its activity
for this soul with the thought, <q>I am discovered.</q>
It has performed what it was destined to perform,
and withdraws from the soul that has attained the
highest goal, as a dancing girl stops dancing when
she has performed her task and the spectators have
enough. But in one respect matter is unlike the
dancing girl or actress; for while they repeat their
performance at request, matter <q>is tenderly disposed
like a woman of good family,</q> who, if she is
seen by a man, modestly does not display herself
again to his view. This last simile is facilitated in
the original texts by the fact that the Sanskrit for
soul and man has the same phonetic notation (pums,
purusa). (Garbe, l. c., pp. 165 ff.)
</p>

<p>
In comparing the common mystic content of Vedanta
and Samkhya-Yoga with alchemy, I avoid the
difficulty involved in establishing a detailed concordance
<pb n="360"/><anchor id="Pg360"/>
of the hermetic philosophy with one or
another system. An inquiry into this topic would
result differently according to which hermetic authors
we should particularly consider.
</p>

<p>
It is probably worthy of notice that the Yoga-Mystics,
like the alchemists, are acquainted with
the idea of the union of the sun and the moon. Two
breath or life currents are to be united, one of which
corresponds to the sun, the other to the moon. The
expression Hathayoga (where hatha = mighty effort.
Cf. Garbe, Samkhya and Yoga, p. 43) will
also be interpreted so that Ha = sun, tha = moon,
their union = the yoga leading to salvation. (Cf.
Hatha-Yoga-Prad., p. 1.)
</p>

<p>
The union of two things, the sun with the moon,
the soul with God, the seer with the seen, etc., is
also taught by the image of the connection of man
and woman. That is the mystic marriage (Hieros
gamos), a universally widespread symbol of quite
supreme importance. In alchemy the last process,
i.e., according to the viewpoint of representation, the
tincturing or the unification, is quite frequently represented
in the guise of a marriage&mdash;sometimes of a
king and a queen. We cannot interchange this final
process with the initial one of introversion, which
(as a seeking for the uterus for the purpose of a rebirth)
is likewise readily conceived of as a sexual
union. If the symbol of coitus was conceivable
there, so here, too, the same symbol is appropriate
for the representation of the definite union with the
object longed for.
</p>

<pb n="361"/><anchor id="Pg361"/>

<p>
It is quite suggestive to associate the anagogic
idea of the <hi rend='italic'>Unio mystica</hi>, precisely on account of the
erotic allegory, with the primal motive of sexual
union (with the mother) instead of with the wish to
die, as I have done at another place. It may be that
the primal erotic power supplies something for the
accomplishment of this last purpose; it may be that
all powers must coöperate. If I now still abide by
my original exposition, this happens because it appears
to me that the symbolism emphasizes the going
over of the one into the other more than the attainment
of the sexual goal; and even in the cases where
the unio mystica is described as a sexual union. We
should not forget that the sexual gratification is to
be regarded also as a kind of annihilation. It is a
condition of intoxication and of oblivion or perishing.
It is this side of the sexual procedure that the
symbolism of the unio mystica particularly emphasizes.
</p>

<p>
Brhadaranyaka-Upanisad, IV, 3, 21: <q>... For
even as one embraced by a beloved woman has no
consciousness of what is within or without, so the
spirit, embraced by the most percipient self (prajena
almana, i.e., the Brahm), has no knowledge of
that which is external or internal. That is its form
of existence, in which it is characterized by stilled
desire, even its own desire is without desire and separated
from sorrow.</q> This passage treats of the
deep sleep (susupti) which is regarded as a passing
union with the highest spirit, and so, as essentially
the same as the definitive <hi rend='italic'>unificatio</hi>. Sleep is the
<pb n="362"/><anchor id="Pg362"/>
brother of death. Susupti is, furthermore, conceived
only as a preliminary; a German mystic would
call it a foretaste of the definitive ascent into Brahm.
</p>

<p>
In the parable the unio mystica appears twice
represented, once in that the king and queen are represented
as the bridal couple, and the second time
when the king, i.e., God, takes the wanderer up into
his kingdom.
</p>

<p>
The attainment of an inner harmony, of a serene
peace, is what, as it seems to me, is most clearly
brought out as the characteristic of the final unificatio&mdash;not
merely by the Hindus or Neoplatonists,
but also by the Christian mystics and by the alchemists.
</p>

<p>
Artephius is quoted by H. A., p. 86, as follows:
<q>... This water [water of life] causes the dead
body to vegetate, increase and spring forth, and to
rise from death to life by being dissolved first, and
then sublimed. And in doing this the body is converted
into a spirit, and the spirit afterwards into
a body; and then is effected the amity, the peace, the
concord and the union of the contraries.</q>
</p>

<p>
Similarly Ripley (H. A., p. 245): <q>This is the
highest perfection to which any sublunary body can
be brought, by which we know that God is one, for
God is perfection; to which, whenever any creature
arrives in its kind [according to its nature], it rejoiceth
in unity, in which there is no division nor
alterity, but peace and rest without contention.</q>
</p>

<p>
The final character of the completed philosopher's
stone makes it conceivable, that, as the hermetic
<pb n="363"/><anchor id="Pg363"/>
masters say, it is made only once by a man and then
not again. The Stone is an absolutely imperishable
Good; but if it should be lost it is surely not the
right stone.
</p>

<p>
I have now to offer some conjectures regarding
further interpretations of the two and the three principles
[Symbol: Gold] and [Symbol: Silver], namely [Symbol: Sulfur] [Symbol: Mercury]
[Symbol: Salt]. We are aware
of a general difference. I add now first the remark
of Hitchcock that the <q>two</q> things are to be regarded
as an antithesis: <hi rend='italic'>natura naturans</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>natura
naturata</hi>. We might intellectually conceive the [Symbol: Mercury]
(mercury) given by many writers at the beginning
of the work as a double one, on the one hand as
nature and on the other as our world picture. We
cause it to work on our [Symbol: Sulphur] (sulphur), i.e., on our
affectivity by which the [Symbol: Sulphur] is purified and dissolved,
for it is compelled to adapt itself to the requirements
of the world laws. But by this means a new world
picture is produced, for the former had been influenced
by the unclarified [Symbol: Sulphur]; our affective life limits
our intellectual. The new world picture or the
newly gained [Symbol: Mercury] we combine with our [Symbol: Sulfur] and so on,
until finally after a gradual clarification nature and
our world picture harmonize. Then there are no
longer two mercuries but only one; and the sulphur,
our completed subject, has become more or less a
unity. Now we may advance to the unification of
the two clarified things, which in this stage are called
[Symbol: Gold] and [Symbol: Silver]. Now subject and object are bound together
and man enters, as is so wonderfully expressed
in Chandogya-Upanisad, VIII, 13, as a being
<pb n="364"/><anchor id="Pg364"/>
adapted into the unadapted (uncreated-primordial)
world of Brahma. [Symbol: Sol] and [Symbol: Luna] may, to be sure, be
conceived also as the love of God towards man and
the love of man towards God. The different masters
of the art are the same in different ways in that
the one sees more the intellectual, the other the emotional.
They describe different sides or aspects of
the same process, for which we do not indeed possess
appropriate concepts, and whose best form of
expression is through symbols. The sign [Symbol: Sol] is then
neither = subject nor love but just = [Symbol: Sol], i.e., a thing
to which we may approximate nearest by a form of
integration of all partial meanings. In view of the
fact that [Symbol: Sulfur] and [Symbol: Mercury] are contrasted at the beginning
of the process also as body and soul, we can, by
making [Symbol: Sulfur] = passions and [Symbol: Mercury] = knowledge (reason)
conceive the rest thus: [Symbol: Sulfur] is to be purified by
an exalted [Symbol: Mercury] (in distinction from the common [Symbol: Mercury],
called also <q>our</q> [Symbol: Mercury]), and so to be purified by a
higher knowledge. From [Symbol: Sulfur] is developed (i.e., it
unmasks itself to the initiated as) [Symbol: Luna], i.e., Maya, the
object, that in its difference from the subject is mere
illusion; and from [Symbol: Mercury] comes [Symbol: Sol], the Brahm or subject,
and now the <hi rend='italic'>unio mystica</hi> can take place. Another
use of symbolism is the one by which we are
able to concoct gold out of sulphur; from the affects
we derive, through purification, love (toward God).
The spirit [Symbol: Mercury] exalts [raises] the antithesis [Symbol: Sol] and
[Symbol: Luna] (soul and body) in such a way that finally it simply
opposes itself as subject and object. (Cf. H. A.,
pp. 143 ff.)
</p>

<pb n="365"/><anchor id="Pg365"/>

<p>
Sometimes the making of gold is described as an
amalgamation; from the raw material, [Symbol: Sol] is derived
by an amalgamation with [Symbol: Mercury] [quicksilver]. That
naturally signifies the search for the Atman or highest
spirit in man by means of contemplation, which
belongs to [Symbol: Mercury], the [act of] knowing.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the trinity [Symbol: Sol] [Symbol: Luna] [Symbol: Mercury]: The solar
divinity [creating, impregnating] in man is [Symbol: Sulfur] that
by its triangle moreover marks the fiery nature [Symbol: Sulfur];
that which is comprised in the bodily nature, the terrestrial
is [Symbol: Salt] salt, which is also represented as a cube,
like the element earth. The two can be called [Symbol: Sol],
anima, and [Symbol: Luna], corpus. The celestial messenger who
appears as a mediator for the antithesis is the conscience
[Symbol: Mercury], who has his constant influx from God, the
real [Symbol: Sol], and is therefore a divine spirit. We have
then the triad Spiritus, anima, corpus [[Symbol: Mercury] [Symbol: Sol] [Symbol: Luna]]
or, because [Symbol: Mercury] is to be regarded as a mediator,
[Symbol: Sol] [Symbol: Mercury] [Symbol: Luna].
The intervention of the [Symbol: Mercury] effects the previously mentioned
exaltation of [Symbol: Sol] and [Symbol: Luna] or of [Symbol: Sulfur] and
[Symbol: Mercury] (crude state) to [Symbol: Sol] and [Symbol: Luna].
</p>

<p>
In view of the difficulty of the mystic work that
attempts to accomplish a sheerly superhuman task, it
is not surprising that it cannot be finished in one attempt
but requires time. It necessitates great persistence.
In the life of the mystic the states of love
and aspiration for God alternate with those of spiritual
helplessness and barrenness. (Horten, Myst.,
I, p. 9.)
</p>

<p>
Arabi sings in his ode on man's becoming godlike:
<q>[1] O thou ancient temple. A light has arisen
<pb n="366"/><anchor id="Pg366"/>
for thee (you) that gleams in our hearts. [2] To
thee I lament the wilderness that I have traversed,
and in which I have poured forth an unlimited flood
of tears. [3] Neither at dawn nor at dusk do I
get repose. From morning until evening I fare on
my way without ceasing. [4] The camels go forth
on their journey at night; even if they have injured
their feet, they still hasten. [5] These (mighty)
riding camels bore us to you (probably God) with
passionate longing, although they did not hope to
attain the goal....</q> The riding camels signify
the longing of the mystics for God. <q>It seeks and
strives ceaselessly, although its powers are drained
by the difficulties of the search.</q> (Horten, l. c., p.
16 ff.)
</p>

<p>
Many degrees or stations are to be gone over on
the difficult way, yet zeal is to abide constant in all
circumstances. [The idea of the ladder set up to
heaven, of steps, etc., is universal in religions.] In
general seven such steps are distinguished. In
Khunrath, e.g., the citadel of Pallas has seven steps.
Paracelsus (De Natura Rerum, VIII), following a
favorite custom, gives seven operations of the work.
<q>... It is now necessary to know the degrees and
steps to transmutation, and how many they are.
These steps are then no more than seven. Although
some count still more, it should not be so. For the
most important steps are seven. The further ones,
however, which might be reckoned as steps are comprised
under the others, which are as follows: calcination
[sublimation], dissolution, putrefaction, distillation,
<pb n="367"/><anchor id="Pg367"/>
coagulation, and tincturing. Whoever
passes over these seven steps and degrees comes to
such a marvelous place, where he sees much mystery
and attains the transmutation of all natural things.</q>
In the <q>Rosarium</q> of Johannes Daustenius
[Chap. XVII] the seven steps are represented as
follows: <q>And then the corpus [1] is a cause that
the water is retained. The water [2] is the cause
of preserving the oil so that it is not ignited on the
fire, and the oil [3] is the cause of retaining the
tincture, and the tincture [4] is a cause of the colors
appearing, and the color [5] is a cause of showing
the white, and the white [6] is a cause of keeping
every volatile thing [7] from being no longer volatile.</q>
It amounts to the same thing when Bonaventura
describes septem gradus contemplationis [seven
steps of contemplation], and David of Augsburg
[13th century] the <q>seven steps of prayer.</q>
Boehme recognizes 7 fountain spirits that constitute
a certain gradation and in the yoga we also find
7 steps, which are described in the <q>Yoga Vasistha</q>
(cf. Hath. Prad., pp. 2 ff). It may easily happen
that the domination of the number 7 is to be
derived from the infusion of the scientific doctrines
(7 planets, 7 metals, 7 tones in the diatonic scale)
and yet it may depend on an actual correspondence
in the human psyche with nature&mdash;who can tell?
Most significant is the connection of the 7 steps of
development with the infusion of the nature myth
in the alchemistic theories of <q>rotations.</q> For the
perfection of the Stone, rotations (i.e., cycles) are

required by many authors, in which the materia (and
so the soul) pass through the spheres of all the
planets. They have to be subjected successively to
the domination (the regimen) of all seven planets.
This is related to the ideas of those neoplatonists
and gnostics according to which the soul must, on
its way (anodos) to its heavenly home, i.e., to its
celestial goal, pass through all the planetary spheres
and through the animal cycle. (Cf. Bousset,
Hauptpr. d. G., pp. 11 and 321.) I observe, moreover,
a thoroughly vivid representation of this very
theme in the good old Mosheim, Ketzergesch., p.
89 ff. Also in the life of the world, if it is completely
lived, man passes through, according to the
ideas of the old mystery teachings, the domination
of the seven planets.

The anagogic meaning of rotation may be that

</p>

<p>
More important, or at any rate more easily comprehensible,
appears to me the trichotomy necessarily
resulting from the course of the mystical work, a
triplicate division that results in the three main
phases, black, white, and red. The black corresponds
to introversion and to the first [mystic]
death, the white to the <q>new earth,</q> to freedom or
innocence, red to love, which completes the work.
This general arrangement does not prevent the symbols
from being often confused by the alchemistic
authors. There are gradations between the main
colors, all kinds of color play; in particular the so-called
<pb n="369"/><anchor id="Pg369"/>
peacock's tail appears, which comes before the
stable white to indicate the characteristic gayness of
color of visionary experiences, and which marks the
stage of introversion.
</p>

<p>
If one put into the center of vision, as goal of
the work, the recovery of the harmonious state of
the soul, one might express oneself about the three
primary colors as follows: The paradisical state
demands absolute freedom from conflict. We can
attain this only by completely withdrawing from the
external world whatever causes conflict in connection
with the external world, so that there comes to pass
with regard to it, a thorough-going indifference.
This indifference is the black. The freedom from
conflict (guiltlessness) in the now newly beginning
life is the white. Previously, at the disintegration
(rotting) of the material, one constituent part was
removed and taken away. That is, the libido becomes
free (love). It is gradually alloyed with the
white material, which is dry (thirsty without thirst);
sown in the white ground. Life is without conflict
now drenched with love, red. This true red thus
attained is permanent because it is produced [in contrast
to mere instruction] from the heart of hearts,
the roots of innermost feeling, which is subjected
to no usury.
</p>

<p>
The mystical procedure can be realized in different
degrees of intensity. The lowest degree is as a
program with the mere result of a stimulation; the
highest degree is a final transmutation of the psyche.
If this goal is attained in life, we have acquired the
<pb n="370"/><anchor id="Pg370"/>
terrestrial stone. In contrast, the celestial stone belongs
with the eschatological concepts and the celestial
tincture is the apokatastasis.
</p>

<p>
It is an interesting question whether the resolution
of conflicts, with evasion of the process in the
outer world, cannot be accomplished subjectively,
by battles with symbols (personifications) and in
symbols, thus amounting to an abbreviation of the
process. Theoretically this is not impossible, for
the conflicts do not indeed lie in the external world,
but in our emotional disposition towards it; if we
change this disposition by an inner development, the
external world has a different value for the libido.
</p>

<p>
<q>The projection into the cosmic is the primal
privilege of the libido, for it naturally enters into
our perception through the gates of all the senses
and apparently from without, and actually, in the
form of the pleasure and pain qualities of perception.
These, as we all know, we attribute without
further deliberation to the object, and their cause,
in spite of philosophical deliberation, we are continually
inclined to look for in the object, while the
object is often hopelessly innocent of it.</q> (Jung,
in Jb. ps. F., III, p. 222; with which compare the
Freudian transference concept and Ferenczi's essay
on <q>Introjektion und Ubertragung,</q> in Jb. ps. F.,
I, p. 422.) Jung calls attention to the frequently
described immediate projection of the libido in love
poetry, as in the following example from the Edda
(H. Gering):

<p>
The mystic looks for the conflicts that he desires
to do away with, in man, the place where they really
exist. With this theoretical presumption the possible
objection against all mysticism is averted, namely
that it is valueless because it rests merely upon imagined
experiences, upon fanaticism. This objection,
though not to be overlooked, does not apply to mysticism,
which accomplishes an actual ethical work
of enduring value&mdash;but to the other path that issues
from introversion, namely magic (not to mention
physical and spiritual suicide). This is nicely expressed,
too, in an allegorical way by saying that
magically-made gold melts, as the story goes, or
turns into mud (i.e., the pretended value vanishes in
the face of actuality) while <q>our</q> alchemistic gold
is an everlasting good. The yoga doctrine, too, describes
Siddhi (those imaginary wonders in which
the visionary loses himself) as transitory, only salvation
alone, i.e., the mystical goal being imperishable.
</p>

<p>
As for the metaphysical import of the mystical
doctrine, I might maintain that the psychoanalytic
unmasking of the impelling powers cannot prejudice
its value. I do not venture at all upon this valuation;
but for the very purpose of bringing into
prominence a separate philosophical problem, I must
<pb n="372"/><anchor id="Pg372"/>
emphatically declare that if psychoanalysis makes it
conceivable that we men, impelled by this and that
<q>titanic</q> primal power, are necessitated to hit upon
this or that idea, then even if it is made clear what
causes us to light upon it, still nothing is as yet settled
as to the value for knowledge of the thing discovered.
</p>

<p>
I am so far from wishing to derive a critique of
the metaphysical import of the doctrine from psychoanalytic
grounds alone, that I felt called upon
to make claim only to a synthesis for the merely
psychological understanding of mystic symbolism, a
synthesis which I have attempted to block out as
well as I was able in the present Part III of my
book.

<p>
It has been mentioned that the work of perfecting
mankind might be realized in different degrees
of intensity, which might extend from complete living
realization to mere sympathy without any clear
comprehension. The psychic types in which the realization
is achieved are, it may be said, identical.
</p>

<p>
These typical groups of symbols that the mystic
[I draw a certain distinction between the mystes and
the mystic. The latter is a mystes who makes a system
of what he has realized.] produces as a functional
expression of his subjective transformation,
can be thought of as an educational method applied
to arouse the same reactions in other men. In the
group of symbols are contained more or less clearly
the already mentioned elementary types as they are
common to all men; they strike the same chords in
all men. Symbolism is for this very reason the most
universal language that can be conceived. It is also
the only language that is adapted to the various degrees
of intensity as well as to the different levels
of the intro-determination of living experience without
requiring therefore a different means of expression;
for what it contains and works with are the
elementary types themselves [or symbols which are
<pb n="374"/><anchor id="Pg374"/>
as adequate as possible to them] which, as we have
seen, represent a permanent element in the stream of
change. This series of symbols is quite as useful to
the neophyte as to the one who is near to perfection;
every one will find in the symbols something that
touches him closely; and what must be particularly
emphasized is that the individual at every spiritual
advance that he makes, will always find something
new in the symbols already familiar to him, and
therefore something to learn. To be sure, this new
revelation is founded in himself; but there results
for the uncritical mind (mythological level) the illusion
that the symbols (e.g., those of the holy scripture)
are endowed with a miraculous power which
implies a divine revelation. [Cf. the concept of the
origin of the symbol in my essay, Phant. u. Myth.]
Because of a similar illusion, e.g., Jamblichus posits
demons between gods and men, who make comprehensible
to the latter the utterances of the gods; the
demons, he thinks, are servants of the gods and execute
their will. They make visible to men in works
and words the invisible and inexpressible things of
the gods; the formless they reveal in forms and
they reveal in concepts what transcends all concepts.
From the gods they receive all the good of which
they are capable, partially or according to their nature,
and share it again with the races that stand
below them.
</p>

<p>
I said above, every one will find something appropriate
to himself in the symbols, and I emphasized
the great constancy of the types fast rooted in the
<pb n="375"/><anchor id="Pg375"/>
unconscious, types which impart to them a universal
validity. The divine is revealed <q>only objectively
different according to the disposition of the vessel
into which it falls, to one one way, another to another.
To the rich poetical genius it is revealed preeminently
in the activity of his imagination; to the
philosophical understanding as the scheme of a harmonious
system. It sinks into the depths of the soul
of the religious, and exalts the strong constructive
will like a divine power. And so the divine is honored
differently by each one.</q> (Ennemoser, Gesch.
d. M., p. 109.) <q>The spiritual element of the inheritance
handed down by our fathers works out
vigorously in the once for all established style....
On the dark background of the soul stand, as it were,
the magic symbols in definite types, and it requires
but an inner or outer touch [E.g., by religious observances.]
to make them kindle and become active.</q>
(Ib., p. 274.) <q>The unconscious is common to all
mankind in an infinitely greater degree than the content
of the individual consciousness, for it is the
condensation of the historically average and oft-repeated.</q>
(Jung, Jb. ps. F., III, pp. 169 ff.)
</p>

<p>
Whoever allows the educative symbols to work
upon him, whether he sees only darkly the ethical
applications typified in them, or clearly perceives
them, or completely realizes them in himself, in any
case he will be able to enjoy a satisfying sense of
purification for his earnest endeavor in an ethical
direction. The just mentioned dim perception
(probably the most frequent case), does not exclude
<pb n="376"/><anchor id="Pg376"/>
the existence of very clear ideas in consciousness; the
person in question generally considers his ideas, although
they are only masks in front of the absolute
ideal, as the ultimate sense of the symbol, thus accepting
one degree of significance for the complete
meaning. Every one approximates the ideal as he
can; the absolute ideal through his ephemeral, but
attainable ideal. The highest being speaks in the
inexhaustible Bhagavad-Gita:

<p>
If above I derived the instructive group of symbols
from a mystic, that is not to say that it must be
precisely so. I brought out this case among possible
<pb n="377"/><anchor id="Pg377"/>
cases only for the reason that the mystic is the one
who carries out most strenuously the ethical work of
purification, and under such conditions as are most
favorable to a suggestive group of symbols, and in
particular those rich in characteristic types. Bear
in mind the founders of religion. (They do not always
have to be individuals&mdash;schools, myths.)
There are, however, others than the religiously inspired
natures, who are preëminently endowed to
produce suggestive symbol groups with anagogic
value; the artists. I suspect that it would prove
that the purifying (cathartic) action of a work of
art is the greater the more strongly the anagogic
symbolism (the groups of types that carry it) is developed,
or in other words, the more they express
a tendency to a broadening of the personality. This
tendency, to which belong the motives of the denial
of the selfish will (father figure) of the love that is
connected with sacrifice (incest motive, regeneration)
of the devotion to an ideal (longing for
death), etc., is manifested in the artist as also in the
devout observer of the work of art in his very devotion
to it. Being lost in a work of art appears to me
essentially related both to introversion and to the
unio mystica.
</p>

<p>
I have already spoken of the creations of the
myth forming imagination and its anagogic import.
In alchemy, to which I wish now to return, the mythical
and the individual images meet in the most vivid
way, without destroying each other.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the high ethical aspirations of alchemy,
<pb n="378"/><anchor id="Pg378"/>
we understand that as a mystic art it preserves
those attributes of a royal art which it seems
to have had at first merely as gold making and magic.
In fact what art may more justly be called royal
than that of the perfection of mankind, that art
which turns the dependent into the independent, the
slave into a master? The freeing of the will in the
mystic (and in every ethical) process has already,
I believe, been commented on enough to be comprehensible.
And the power of rule that has been extolled
as a magical effect of the Philosopher's Stone
lies in the harmonizing of the individual will with
that of the world or with God's will. In the new
birth&mdash;so remarks Jane Leade casually&mdash;we acquire
a magic power; this occurs <q>through faith,
that is, through the harmony of our will with the
divine will. For faith puts the world in our power,
inasmuch as the harmony of our will with the divine
has the result of making everything ours or obedient
to us. The will of the soul, when it accords wholly
with the divine, is no longer a naked will lacking its
raiment, power, but brings with it an invincible omnipotence.</q>
</p>

<p>
To-day, too, there is a royal art. Freemasonry
bears this name. Not only the name but its ethical
ideal connects it with the spirit of the old alchemy.
This statement will probably be contradicted and
meet the same denial as did once the ideas of
Kernning [J. Krebs], although I think I am on different
ground from that of this poetic but, in my
eyes, all too uncritical author. Keep in mind the
<pb n="379"/><anchor id="Pg379"/>
historical treatment mentioned in Part I, Section 4,
and furthermore do not forget the psychological
basis of our present modes of viewing things.
</p>

<p>
[If I wished to compare the ethical aims of both
in general terms, I should run the risk of unduly
expatiating on what is easily understood. Robert
Fischer describes freemasonry as a society of men
who have set themselves the severe task of a wise
life and labor as the most difficult task, of self-knowledge,
self-mastery and self-improvement,&mdash;tasks
that are not finished in this life but only through
death prepare us for the stage where the true consummation
begins. These beautiful and straightforward
words could just as well stand in an alchemistic
discussion on the terrestrial and celestial.
But this will suffice.]
</p>

<p>
And now permit me to present the following portrayals
by Jane Leade [English mystic of the 17th
century. She belonged to the philadelphian society
founded by Pordage.] which I reproduce here with
a few words of comment, and take them as an illustration
of the beautiful spiritual union of the serious
hermetic with the new royal art. The reader can
draw his own conclusions. The passages are taken
from Leade's <q>Garten-Brunn</q> (L. G. B.). References
to Wirth are to the <q>Symbolisme Hermétique</q>
(W. S. H.) of this modern author.
</p>

<p>
This mystic who is sunk in deep meditation on
the noble Stone of divine Wisdom, has a vision of
Sophia (Wisdom) at which she is startled. <q>Soon
came the voice and said: Behold I am God's everlasting
<pb n="380"/><anchor id="Pg380"/>
handmaid of wisdom, whom thou hast sought.
I am now here to unseal for thee the treasures of the
deepest wisdom of God, and to be to thee even that
which Rebecca was to her son Jacob, namely, a true,
natural mother. For from my body and womb shalt
thou be born, conceived and reborn.</q> (L. G. B.,
I, p. 14.)
</p>

<p>
Leade is much rejoiced that the <q>morning star
from on high</q> has sought her, and secludes herself
for the following days to await further developments.
She has still more visions of the crowned
queen of heaven and was asked whether she had the
desire to be taken up into the celestial company. She
proves herself of constantly devoted will and from
this time wisdom speaks to her as an inner illumination.
(L. G. B., I, p. 15 ff.)
</p>

<p>
[Retirement is a precondition of introversion and
of withdrawal into oneself. The uninitiated who
is to be admitted is, to use the language of alchemy,
the subjectum, in whom the process of purification
is to be perfected. The alchemists put the subjectum
into a narrow vessel so as to be hermetically sealed
from the outer world. There it is subjected to
putrefaction as in a grave. Introversion leads into
the depths of one's very heart. <q>Where were you
formed?</q> <q>In my heart [or inner man].</q>
<q>Where after this?</q> <q>In the Way to the Lodge.</q>

<q>Because I was in darkness and desired light.</q>
The death symbol in the sch. K. is later to be considered.
I can naturally go into a few only of the
analogies. The informed reader will largely increase
the number of parallels very easily.]
</p>

<p>
Jane Leade seeks in the spirit for the key that can
open the entrance into the great secret that lies deep
hidden within her. Her effort to reach the holy city
is great but at first ineffectual. [One is not admitted
without further effort.] She wanders around the
city and finds no entrance. [Way to the Lodge&mdash;<q>Why
have they not led you the nearest way to the
Lodge?</q> <q>In order to acquaint me with the difficulties
and troubles that one must first overcome before
one finds the way of virtue.</q>] She is apprehensive
that she must, lacking the wonderful key, now
grope all her days in darkness ... never find the
gate. <q>While I, now overpowered with fear and
horror at all this, was plunged [Symbols and processes
in the sch. K. Roll of the terrible Br. It is
probably well founded psychologically, a fact that I
should like to emphasize in opposition to Fischer,
Kat. Erl., I, on Question 7.] into a deep silence and
stillness, the word of wisdom itself was revealed to
me and said: <q>O deeply searching spirit, be not surprised
that you have not realized your hopes for so
long a time. So far you have been with many others
caught in a great error, yet as you know and are
sorry for your error, I will apprize you what sort of
a key it must be.... And although this wonderful
Key of Wisdom is a free gift, it will yet come to be of
<pb n="382"/><anchor id="Pg382"/>
high value to you, O searching spirit, when once you
obtain it.</q></q> Nevertheless wisdom goes about and
looks for those who deserve it, [Nothing being made
of nothing, the point of departure of the philosophic
work is the finding and choice of the subject. The
material to work upon, say the alchemists, is quite
common and is met with everywhere. It is necessary
only to know how to distinguish it, and that is
where all the difficulty lies. We continually experience
it in masonry, for we often initiate the profane,
whom we should have rejected had we been sufficiently
clear sighted. Not all material is good to
make a mercury. The work can succeed only if we
succeed in finding a suitable subject; so masonry
makes many inquiries before admitting a candidate
to the tests. (W. S. H., p. 87.)] She does this so
as to write herself on the inner walls of their hearts
and in each and every one meet their thoughts which
wait upon her laws and counsel, [Obedience of apprentices.
The laws of wisdom are meant.] and
brings a kingdom with it which will be well worth
sacrificing everything for. [Laying aside of all
metal. The newly admitted brother is <q>through his
unclothing</q> (which probably belongs here) to represent
mankind symbolically, as he comes from the
hand of nature, and to remind us that the freemason,
in order to be continuously mindful of the
fulfillment of his duty must be able to rid himself of
all fortuitous externalities. See <ref target="Note_H">Note H</ref> at end.]
But the greatest and most distinguished master work,
says wisdom, consists alone in your keeping your
<pb n="383"/><anchor id="Pg383"/>
spirit disciplined and learned, and making it a skilled
worker or artist, to give it knowledge of what material,
as well as in what number, weight and measure
[Surveying, geometry.] to make this pure key, which
[material] is the bright pure divinity in the number
three, the mighty in truth.... It is distinguished
as a surpassingly mighty glory and lordliness which
sits in a circle of heaven within the hearts of men.
[The connection of circle (doubly significant) and
heart is interesting. As is well known the circle is
placed on the bleeding left breast. In the old English
ritual the touching with the point of an instrument
(sword or the like) is proved <q>Because the left
breast is nearest to the heart, so that it may be so
much the more a prick in my conscience as it then
pricked my skin.</q>] It does with the plumbline of its
power measure the temple and inner court with those
who worship there. [The line in connection with
the temple: the <q>binding</q> on a carpet; an image of
the curtain string in the holy of holies in Solomon's
temple. <q>Just as this ribbon holds and closes the
curtain, so an indissoluble bond unites and holds together
all free and accepted Masonic brothers (also
those who worship therein).</q> This is wisdom's key
[Surveying, Geometry.] which will make our hands
drop with sweet smelling myrrh upon the handles of
the lock (Solomon's Song, V, 5). When now I
opened your secret gate with this key, my soul failed
within me and I had no strength in me, the sun of
reason and the moon of my extended senses were confounded
and vanished. I knew nothing by myself of
<pb n="384"/><anchor id="Pg384"/>
the active properties of nature and the creature.
<q>What have you seen as ...?</q> <q>Nothing that
reason can grasp.</q>] The wheel of motion stood
still and something else was moved by a central fire,
so that I felt myself turned into a bright flame.
Whereupon this word came to me: This is nothing
else than the gate of my everlasting depths; can you
stay in this fiery region, which is wisdom's dwelling
and abode, in which it meets holy remote spirits and
gives them a fiery principle? For if thou canst take
heed such that thou comest hither at its order; then
no secret shall be kept from thee. So far I have been
permitted to approach the entrance to your house,
where I must still stay until I hear further from you
what is to be done. (L. G. B., I, pp. 17-19.)
</p>

<p>
[As we hear it is therefore right to keep the
spirit corrected and disciplined. <q>Why came ye ...
to subdue my passions&mdash;to subject my will....</q>
We see two triads. A divine three (3 great lights),
and then sun, moon and central fire, which second
three can be called the lesser lights, as the <q>M. v.
St.</q> appears as a central fire. If we remember that
the didactic voice proceeds, according to this symbolism,
from a fire or light (Wisdom), this light is
identical with the M. v. St. in the function, and it is
determined by exactly that. The central fire is
naturally also the blazing star. This stands on the
tapis between sun and moon and it is designed to
illuminate the innermost space of the temple. From
alchemy we are well acquainted with [Symbol: Sun], [Symbol: Moon] and an
intermediate and mediating light, namely [Symbol: Mercury]. This
<pb n="385"/><anchor id="Pg385"/>
light can be also symbolized as [Symbol: Star of David]. To the alchemistic
point of view correspond quite closely the
three great lights of the Freiburg Ritual, God, man
and St. John's light. This (the [Symbol: mercury]) is the intelligence
and the talent in men which creates all science
and shows us the truth. It is <q>the only authority
that the freemason has to recognize unconditionally,
namely, the divine ordinance in his own heart, the
celestial fire in his ego.</q>]
</p>

<p>
Several weeks later Leade hears again the voice
of wisdom. It said to her: <q>Separate thyself
and withdraw from thy animal sensuous life, it is too
coarse. I cannot appear till that is completely lost
and vanished.</q> [The alchemistic separation (separatio)
and the masonic taking off of parts of their
clothing. I have already made the most necessary
remarks about it. We have to be freed from the
things which, as in the eclectic ritual <q>much retard
the soaring of the spirit and chain man to the earth.</q>
It has an expressly programmatical meaning (anticipating
a later phase) when, e.g., the system of the
Grand Lodge goes back, for the deprivation from
the metal, to <q>the temple of Solomon that was
built of fully prepared stones, just as they were
brought, etc.,</q> so that no metal work was needed.]
A short time after Leade is again driven to search
after the secret being. Wisdom requires it to know
itself apart from its creature existence. <q>Whereupon
I was surrounded by gently burning flames that
consumed and burned all thistles, thorns and accursed
fluxes [the <q>superfluities</q> of alchemy] which would
<pb n="386"/><anchor id="Pg386"/>
put themselves forward.... Therefore Wisdom
let her voice be heard and said: <q>O thou troubled
spirit, I am now come to tell thee what was required
of thee, as I have not refrained from saying to thee,
even at the beginning of my discourse with thee,
what it would cost thee to attain this key. [First
programmatically shown. The actual process will
then follow.] I say to thee, God requires a sacrifice
of thee. Understand me then, thou hast an earthly
element that has spread and covered [Like a garment.]
thee, and consequently has got the upper
hand and mastery of thee; these thrones and powers
[king or father figure] must, however, be overthrown
and their place found no more. Thou hast
deeply mourned that thou hadst to do without the
ever near communion or union with God thy Creator,
[Only the masters sit near the sun.] but be not surprised
at that. The cause lies here in complete extinction
because you are not yet deceased and dead
completely in the mystical manner. [Complete extinction
first results in the third degree.] This is
the first baptism that you must experience, but ah,
how many have rushed into this too abruptly, because
they have not given their earthly selfishness a
single mortal blow right to the heart. [The circle
or sword placed on the left breast alludes merely to
the process of the clearing of conscience. Here the
whole ego is not yet annihilated.] So I recommend
to thee my flaming sword. Be courageous and let it
achieve complete execution in the field of nature
[The weed in the field is exterminated where, as
<pb n="387"/><anchor id="Pg387"/>
Jane Leade frequently says, ears of corn are to
grow.] or banish completely all young or old, and
turn from life toward death whatever in you does
not bear my mark and name that is my image.</q></q>
[From this the psychological sense of the countersign
is recognized. In connection with the field we
are reminded especially of Shibboleth (Judges XIII,
6: The Ephraimites who could not speak it had to
die). Leade often mentions the Ephraimites. Directly
pertinent to the above passage is, of course,
Revelations, passim.] (L. G. B., I, pp. 21 ff.) The
earthly is, as it were, to be sacrificed to God as a
burnt offering or melted away in a fiery furnace, in
a vessel of the purest metal. [Probably it will not
be superfluous to remark that in the Bible the first
worker in all kinds of metal was Tubal Cain, whose
name is a password.] Jane Leade finds <q>the conditions
or circumstances which thou [Wisdom] requirest
of me to be very hard; especially do I find
myself still dwelling in the offspring of a mortal
shadow, where whole millions of spirits tempt me
and employ all their ability and strength to hinder
and hold me back from the high and noble exaltation
and aspiration, [The seductive and restraining voices
in the circuitous way or on the way to the Lodge
according to the eclectic ritual. The band corresponds
to the mortal shadow.] while I, alone
and seeing the receptacle and fire before me, stood in
thought about it and pondered the matter, and was
willing, like Isaac, to ask, But where is the lamb?
[The apron is of lamb's fleece.] She [Sophia =
<pb n="388"/><anchor id="Pg388"/>
Wisdom] answered my unspoken question with these
words: You yourself must be the paschal lamb that
shall be slain. Thereupon I was instructed to say
or to beg: Then give yet this life pulse a stroke so
that it may completely return. And as I stretched
out my neck, so to speak, to the love flaming sword,
I felt that a separation or beheading had taken place.
[Note the baring of the neck, the guttural and its
meaning given according to the content of the old
form of oath. The fate of the traitor befalls the
man who is slain at this point; he has been a traitor to
the inner true man. It is here the place to bear in
mind the descending scale of marks (guttural, pectoral,
stomachal). Man is to be transmuted on rectangular
principles, or in the language of alchemy, is
to be tinctured with the divine tincture. This tincturing
seizes first the most spiritual and advances steadily
until the whole man is transformed. The trichotomy
corresponds to the Platonic (and alchemistic)
tripartite division of the powers of the soul. Plato
distinguishes the reasoning soul, which he places in
the head, the intellectual in the breast, and the affective
in the abdomen. The entire soul, even the vegetative,
is to be illuminated by the highest light. If
we assume that it is more than a pretty picture,
Staudenmaier's view becomes of interest, namely that
man may have an extraordinary spiritual perfection
in bestowing consciousness through practice upon
the centers that ordinarily work vegetatively without
consciousness. In this way he gains power over
a whole army of working powers that otherwise escape
<pb n="389"/><anchor id="Pg389"/>
him. Staudenmaier's own experiences teach
that all the dangers of introversion are connected
with such a training, and it may easily happen that
we are defeated by the spirits that we invoke, instead
of becoming their masters. The absolute mastery of
the rational ego is, however, evidently the foundation
of the ethical work of perfection. Kenning's
doctrine is related to the theories of Staudenmaier.]
Oh, how sweet and pleasant it is to perceive the life
blood flowing into the fountain of the same divinity
from which it came.</q> Whereupon wisdom opened
more of her secrets to her. (L. G. B., I, p. 24.)
</p>

<p>
It may be that this is the most suitable place to
mention another series of visions (apropos of the
building of the tabernacle, L. G. B., I, pp. 24 ff.):
<q>It [the holy ark] is an impregnable fortress and
tower, so go thou not out [so says Wisdom], but
bind thyself and ally thyself here as a disciple, to
hold out to the end, then thou wilt be learned in the
lofty spiritual art of the everlasting mystery, and
be instructed how this incomparable composition or
medicine of the healing elixir and balsam of life is
prepared. Above all thou must enter a bond of
silence and vow to reveal it to no one outside of your
fellow learners, who are called together near and
with you, to work at this very art. [I hardly need
to mention the duty under oath, but will only call
attention to the group of the three virtues of the
newly entering: attentiveness, silence, fidelity.] Further
thou must completely bide the definite time and
year of it, in all fidelity and patience indefatigable,
<pb n="390"/><anchor id="Pg390"/>
until thou succeedest in making this oil as well, and
preserve it in the beautiful snow-white alabaster box
of consummate nature, and art as fit and perfect as
thy instructress.</q>
</p>

<p>
I continue in the earlier series of forms. Jane
Leade is required by wisdom to follow her. <q>But
all of a sudden I was surprised by a mighty enemy,
who pressed me hard while he accused and complained
that I was breaking the laws of nature, to
which I was still bound because I had an external
body, for whose elemental wants I must take reasonable
care, ... as all my neighbors in the world did,
who were under the rule of the grand monarch of
the [worldly calculating] reason, under whose scepter
everything must mortify what lives in the sensual
animal life....</q> [The man who lives only for
the satisfaction of physical needs cannot serve our
purpose.... There is a higher life than that to
which millions are chained like an animal. To this
higher life the Master is to devote himself, and to it
he is metaphorically initiated in the admission.
Common nature, the prince of this world, strives
against these requirements.] <q>Yes,</q> says the prince
of the earthly life, <q>how wilt thou turn aside from
my laws and throw thy brother's yoke from thy
neck?</q> Leade turns to her mother, Wisdom, who
promises her to take God's advice how the enemy
could be driven away. The proof should be that
they were traitors to the crown, to honor, and to the
lordship of the lamb; they would soon be handed
over to justice. (L. G. B., I, pp. 27 ff.) [Cf. on the
<pb n="391"/><anchor id="Pg391"/>
one hand, in connection with <q>accused and complained,</q>
think of the murderer of the royal architect.
As this is the inner man, both belong together.
The <q>prince of this world</q> turns the tables on his
accusation; psychologically quite justifiably.]
</p>

<p>
After various exhortations Jane Leade receives
from Wisdom a book which she, Wisdom, must read
from, <q>in order to explain to you one letter after
another, [Spelling.], especially you do not yet know
the number which makes up your new name. And
as long as you do not see that, what kind of right
and title can you advance for the rest of the entire
mastery that is developed there?</q> (L. G. B., I,
p. 36.) It refers to a transmutation of the man,
which cannot happen all at once; <q>so highly important
a change, that it could not take place without a
passing through many distant degrees.</q> (L. G. B.,
II, p. 78.)
</p>

<p>
We come to a section that is inscribed, <q>The
Magic Journeys.</q> [Probably I shall hardly need
now to refer to the meaning of the journey.] It
contains all the other phases of the mystical work.
<q>During my spiritual journey to the land of all
blessed abundance, a magic outline of it was placed
before my eyes, while I was brought to a door which
was so low and narrow that I could enter it only by
creeping through on my knees, so that it also required
great effort and trouble. [Obstacle of the
door.] And so I was led farther till, after some
time, I came to another door, which was indeed narrow
enough but somewhat more comfortable to go
<pb n="392"/><anchor id="Pg392"/>
through than the first. As I thus proceeded, I came
finally to a door that had two valves, one of which
opened itself, and was quite right in height and width
for my size, and also admitted me to a place of which
I could find neither beginning nor end. And I said,
<q>What am I doing here alone?</q> Whereupon my invisible
guide who had led me through these three
doors or gates replied that still others would come
after me, when they should hear that there was anywhere
so great a country that was to be possessed by
new inhabitants, and that should be filled and blessed
also with all kinds of goods.</q> (L. G. B., I, p. 40.)
[The three gates refer not merely to the three degrees,
but have still for themselves another analogue
in the initiation. In the old English system the aspirant
knocks, because the door offers him a resistance,
on the backs of the three officials. They are,
as it were, the spiritual doors of the brotherhood.
The resistance, and how it is gradually presented in
Leade's description, is readily understood psychologically;
the nature of the aspirant is the more
adapted the further he advances on his work.]
</p>

<p>
<q>This idea and apparition and the account and
explanation following thereupon were very powerful;
so that I entered into the thoughts of it ever
deeper, ... so that I ... also might perceive the
explanation and meaning of the gates. For although
my spirit saw naught but an infinite spaciousness
[compare previous pages] I perceived and felt [Infinite
spread of the lodge in accordance with the examination.]
still the blowing of so fragrant and refreshing
<pb n="393"/><anchor id="Pg393"/>
a breeze, as if all kinds of flowers actually stood
blooming there. [Does the question as to the mason's
wind belong here psychologically? In any
case the pleasant breeze comes from the east. Jane
Leade often describes her flower garden as oriental.
Psychologically and mythologically the breeze has
the value of a spermatic symbol. Anagogically it
is concerned with the bestowing of a power or (to
retain the procreation metaphor) the impregnation
with such a power.] Therefore this word was revealed
and spoken to me: <q>This is space and place
where the love realm is to arise and become verdant
with its natural inhabitants, who have laid aside
their crass self-love [selfishness] and left it behind
them, as it might not come here; even as it is the
one which makes the entrance so narrow and
crowded....</q> Hereupon I saw in my spirit unexpectedly
different persons, modified out of measure
in their bodies, and they were so highly versed in
this mystery that they breathed forth such a spirit
from them that they could give being and existence
to everything that they willed and desired. At times
they spread golden tents and went in and out of
them, at other times in places that appeared to be
quite waste and desolate they made wonderful plants
and trees to grow up, which actually offered their perfect
fruit that appeared in a bright golden radiance;
of which it was related that they were the magical
nourishment and food on which the inhabitants of
this land were supposed to live.</q> [We may also
say the masters of the art cultivate an uncultivated
<pb n="394"/><anchor id="Pg394"/>
people, and provide spiritual nourishment at the
drawing table.] <q>And although at my first entrance
here it seemed that I saw nothing, yet I did
see after a few moments this whole spacious place
filled with spirits of so high a degree that they attracted
me at once. Thereupon they set me divers
philosophical questions [Catechizing.] which I did
not understand. So one of them in a very friendly
manner offered to instruct and teach me; said further
that he would teach me the secret of their art....
Accordingly he brought me into a magnificent
tent, and requested me to wait there so that I might
advance into the pure acts or works of faith, because
I would succeed thereby in becoming an adept in this
high philosophy. Now when, thereupon, Wisdom
herself appeared to me, I asked her who it was that
had set me the philosophical questions? Whereupon
she answered me that they were the old and
last living worthies, and they were the believing holy
ones, taught by her in her inward and outward divine
magic stone; and that the time was coming in which
she desired to make new artists and poets in this
theosophic wisdom, who should give a form to the
things that had been so odiously disgraced and lay
under a cloud of contempt, ignorance and disgrace.
Especially, no other way besides this could be found
than that the deep mine, in which the treasure had
lain hidden so long, should be broken open and unsealed.
[The lost that must be found again is called
in freemasonry the master word. The master wandering
has the object of seeking what was lost there
<pb n="395"/><anchor id="Pg395"/>
[in the East] and has [partly] been found again.]
Hereupon the apostle John [Well beloved] spoke
to me, to whom the secret was well known, and who
was the person who had spoken so kindly to me before,
with these words: <q>Just as a natural stone, so
is there also a spiritual stone which is the root and
the foundation of all that the sons of art have
brought visibly into being and into the light. And
just as the external is corporeal, and consists in work
of the hands, and consumes a great amount of time
before it can be brought to perfection, so also is the
internal elaborated from degree to degree....</q>
Therefore I begged and asked the angel John in what
manner I might go to work, to work out the same?</q>
The <q>angel John</q> accorded her the permission.
Just as a furnace is used for a chemical preparation,
so also a furnace is necessary for the preparation of
the spiritual Philosopher's Stone. This outer furnace
is, however, the corporeal man, in which <q>the
fire seeds of pure divinity itself are kindled by the
essence of the soul, when he finds for it a hallowed
and properly prepared vessel. The materia in
which one must labor or work is the divine salt, which
is placed in a pure clear crystalline glass, the pure
spirit. Further shouldst thou know, that this divine
salt is concealed in all men.</q> (L. G. B., I, pp.
40-43.)
</p>

<p>
Here I must insert the discussion of the salt (also
salt stone) and its effect. We must understand
clearly that the salt stone of this symbolism is the
same as the cubical stone of the masonics. That the
<pb n="396"/><anchor id="Pg396"/>
salt is hieroglyphically represented by a cube, I have
already shown. The concept stone is the parting of
the ways for two symbol groups of similar meaning,
both of which Jane Leade uses. The one group
is the chemical preparation, as the angel John
just now described it; the other is the treatment of
the stone as a building stone (which is to be dressed,
etc.) found in other passages from Jane Leade,
namely, in connection with the building of a temple,
a sanctuary, the New Jerusalem. Important use is
made of men as building stones preëminently in her
<q>Revelation of Revelations.</q> This one passage
from L. G. B. (II, p. 138) may be quoted: <q>Who
will now blow this trumpet of mine that they may
break loose from their iron yokes and bonds and
come hither, so that they may become worthy to be
built in as well-cut pillars for the temple of wisdom.</q>
The quadrangular form is several times mentioned
also. Jane Leade is quite right when she says that
the divine salt, the cubic stone, lies concealed in all
men; the unprepared man is the crude stone and in
him lies to be developed (potentially not actually)
the cubic. In the preparation of the stone, the alchemistic
as well as the building stone, it depends on
the clearing away of the disturbing elements, not on
ornamentation. The purification (rectificatio, purificatio,
etc.) of the alchemistic stone exactly corresponds
to the working over the raw stone with the
pick. Crystallization produces the regular form;
fixation, the density. The projection corresponds to
the employment in the building of the temple (which
<pb n="397"/><anchor id="Pg397"/>
appears infrequently in symbolism). Probably the
most appropriate place for these passages (L. G. B.,
I, pp. 131 ff.) is in connection with this mention of
building. <q>Only have faith, so I will go before you
and reveal my name and show you the foundation
of it [the city], wherefrom your strength increases
and your victorious power shall be known. But who
must be your architect to instruct you in this foundation
work of yours but this Wisdom who was with
the great God Jehovah from eternity, who gave you
existence and being from the breath of the eternal
Will? Therefore thus and in such manner the motivating
power of the will must result and proceed....
Come therefore to me and I will show you
where all these foundation stones lie. Look and see
the material of the treasure in the circumference of
your new earth.... Here you might spy out or
find this foundation, [Cf. what was said previously
about the new earth], for which purpose will be
given to you the golden measuring line, or the plummet
of my spirit.</q> [The master stands on the pillar
of strength. Jehovah was the last master word.]
</p>

<p>
We stopped where the angel John says we should
know that the divine salt is hidden in all men. It
goes on: <q>but it has lost its power and savor, and
such is the principle of light that includes all other
principles, because man, although quite unknown to
himself, is an abstract and concept in brief of all
worlds. Therefore he may find in himself all that he
seeks; only it cannot happen before the salt alone,
which has lain as dead, has been again raised to life
<pb n="398"/><anchor id="Pg398"/>
through Christ the Freestone (who calcines the black
to a jasper brilliance and to a beautiful whiteness).
This is the true theosophic medicine, which indeed
gradually, or little by little, works out of itself, from
itself, and into itself, even as a grain of wheat which
when it is sown does, by the coöperation of the sun
and the outer planets, forms itself into a body.
Only one has to watch and pay attention so that no
birds of prey come and pick it up [Cf. Figure 3, <ref target="Pg199">p.
199</ref>] before it comes to its maturity and full time.
For just such a state [as with the grain of wheat]
exists in the case of the gold stone, which lies hidden
in the foundation of nature, is nourished by the
warm fiery influence of the divine sun and through
the moist seeds of the spiritual Luna [sperma luna]
is watered, which makes it grow through the inner
penetration and union of the planetary powers of
the higher order, which draw the weaker and lower
into themselves, impregnate and swallow them.
Whereby the mastery is obtained over all that is
astral and elemental. In this manner the beloved
John revealed to me the nature of the royal stone,
as it was revealed to him in the island of Patmos
(there by him was brought forth what he possessed
in the spirit). And he told me further concerning
this: that where the universal or general love is born
in any one, such would be the true signature and
token that this seraphic stone would there be formed
and take to itself a bodily shape.</q> (L. G. B., I,
p. 44).
</p>

<p>
[Here we meet clearly the trinity [Symbol: Sun] [Symbol: Philosopher's Stone]
[Symbol: Moon], sun,
<pb n="399"/><anchor id="Pg399"/>
moon, and as an outgrowth of both the [Symbol: Philosopher's Stone] gold stone,
the Philosopher's Stone, which unites in itself the
[Symbol: Gold] and [Symbol: Silver] or which is the same
[Symbol: Fire] and [Symbol: Water]. It is
therefore not at all a mistake to see in the [Symbol: Water] a union
of action and reaction. The G must be conceived
in the anagogic sense, as the genesis of the Philosopher's
Stone or as regeneration.] In L. G. B., I,
p. 147, I find also this remarkable passage: <q>The
word of Jesus was revealed to me in the following
manner: O you that wait upon Jerusalem.
Through what gate have you entered? And what
have you seen here that you are so desirous of living
here? Have you not been taken in by the fire flaming
eye? [The eye is the flaming star. In L. G. B.,
I, p. 196, is found the representation of a face that
is equivalent to the eye. A moon is added to it.
The eye [Symbol: Gold] is, as it were, the sun to this moon.] so
that you intend not to go out again from here, till
you get another heart [The pectoral learns who approaches
to the flaming star.] which never could be
completely changed?... O then be therefore wise,
and await your nuptial spirit [Genesis] and the garment
of the power unfailing. [i. i. d. St.] No one
can ever get that outside of this treasure city, for
in this Zion all must be born anew....</q> [Oswald
Wirth regards the alchemistic concept Rebis
as the expression of the perfect degree of community.
<q>The initiated, who becomes in some
way androgynous, because he unites the virile energy
with the feminine sensitiveness, is represented in alchemy
by the Rebis [from res bina, the double
<pb n="400"/><anchor id="Pg400"/>
thing]. This substance, at once male and female,
is a mercury [Symbol: Mercury] animated by its sulphur [Symbol: Sulphur] and
transformed by this act into Azoth [Symbol: Mercury], i.e., into this quintessence
of the elements [fifth essence] of which the
flaming star is the symbol. It should be noted that
this star is always placed in such a way that it receives
the double radiation of the male sun [Symbol: Gold] and
the female moon [Symbol: Moon]; its light is thus of a bisexual
nature, androgynous or hermaphrodite. The Rebis
corresponds otherwise to the matter prepared by the
final work, otherwise called the journeyman who has
been made worthy to be raised to the mastery.</q>
(W. S. H., p.99.)]
</p>

<p>
But to return to Jane Leade's magical journey.
<q>Hereupon I was moved (because I well knew and
was certain that this heavenly stone already had its
birth and growth in me) [Rebirth = the cubical
stone's change from potentiality to actuality] with
great frankness to ask whether my external furnace
[her own body] would keep so long, and not perish
[die] before the stone would have attained its perfection.
Whereupon this dear saint [John] said to
me in answer: Worry and trouble not yourself
about this but be only patient in hope; for the true
philosophic tree is grown and in a fair way to produce
ripe fruit.</q> (L. G. B., I, pp. 44 ff.) The
preparation of the stone is now described by John
according to the well known outlines. For <q>said
Wisdom and the apostle John to me: Henceforth
you shall be brought to the old worthy heroes of the
faith who have [The masters too.] effected projection
<pb n="401"/><anchor id="Pg401"/>
with the stone [= the work of transmutation].
And after I was brought there I saw the patriarchs
or arch fathers and all the great philosophers, who
had been taught by God himself both in the earlier
and in the later times. After that I was led into a
darkness and gloom, which was of itself changed by
a magic power into a clear silver light.</q> (L. G. B.,
I, p. 46.) Several other allegories follow for the
changing activity, as described already (L. G. B., I,
p. 41). John explains that all the wonders were
accomplished with the stone of wisdom and that whoever
has worked out this stone in himself is marked
as one sealed [Sigillum, Hermetes, Sealing with the
Trowel, mark of salvation, Mark Mason.] of God
with the power from above.
</p>

<p>
A further communication of the preceding vision
[sc. Magic Journey] gives the following additional
information: <q>The Word came to me and said:
The love bond between God and thee must not be
loosened but tightly knotted. Meanwhile the spirit
is the only eternal substance and property in which
thou must labor and toil. That it may then cling
to you so fast and strongly that it may draw thee
quite closely to it and may establish thee within the
circle of the immeasurable love; from which enmity
is sundered, and the curse of the elements is separated
and wholly taken away. O go in, go, I say,
into it, for this is the infinite space, that thou hast
seen, and which is to be found inside the third door.
[Does this need any explanation?] This invisible
love bond will perfect thee through the first gate,
<pb n="402"/><anchor id="Pg402"/>
which is so narrow and low, and therefore also
through the other two gates; in case that thou wilt
yield everything in thee completely in all its length
and breadth so that it may be able quickly to raise
thee. For, dear one, what is to return thee so
mightily to the desired enjoyment of all abundance
and good as the love of God? Therefore be strong
and courageous in love, in going through these divers
gates, and fear not any attack of the adversary till
thou hast entered this hallowed country and art
wedded therein to thy beloved.</q>
</p>

<p>
A complaint that was made of Wisdom by her pilgrim:
<q>Meanwhile as I lay in my deep struggle,
came there a spirit of prayer down, who made an
earnest supplication and unutterable sighing, rise
towards heaven, [The lamentation at the grave of
the Master.] which as I felt most clearly, penetrated
and broke through the gate of the eternal profound,
so that my spirit had an entrance to the secret
chamber of pure godhead, wherein I had audience
and complete freedom to pour out my lamentations
and show my wounds and tell who had pierced me.
For each and every hand was against me, let fly
their stinging arrows at me, and burdened and oppressed
still more that which hung already, dropping
blood, upon the cross, and cried and said,
Crucify, crucify her, make her really feel death in
the dying.... I was in violent birth travail. All
woes and onsets, however, made a greater opening
for the birth of life, and gave me an entrance into
the holy place, wherein first I heard the eternal tones.
<pb n="403"/><anchor id="Pg403"/>
And then after this, as I gained the strength to be
in a pleasant quiet, I was in a clear water, [Tears.],
in which no mud nor any refuse arose; also no implement
was lifted to any work there, nor was any noise
nor uproar heard.</q> [Just as in the building of Solomon's
temple.] (L. G. B., I, p. 48.)
</p>

<p>
Now Leade hears the comforting voice of the
<q>Bridegroom</q> (the unio mystica) which brings to
her view the perfection she has striven for, and commands
her to touch no unclean spirits of this world.
[Gloves.] Only what is detached from sin may
come near him. The bridegroom is answered by
Leade's soul-spirit: <q>Lord, how can this be done?
For although I have had a great longing towards this
ministration [the holy service] that I might be ever
near thee, the spirit of this world [See previous.]
has made claim to this shell or body of mine, and
says that I have not yet stepped out the bounds
and sphere of his dominion. The external man is
encompassed by hunger and thirst, heat and cold [antitheses
of the Hindu philosophy], which are wont
to entangle his external senses in such things as are
external, in such a way that no one can live in such
pure abstraction and seclusion, until he is relieved of
and freed from all care for the external body. This
is what I bewailed with tears, and expressly asked
God whether it was not possible for the eternal mind
and spirit to supply all necessaries for the bodily part
without aid of the spirit of reason, who is king in
that realm where malediction rules?</q> [In other
words, whether it was not possible in the living life
<pb n="404"/><anchor id="Pg404"/>
to be released from contradiction (as it is called in the
Bhagavad-Gita), to quite tear away the bonds of animal
sensuous being, and definitively allow the eternal
principles to be active. The question is whether the
terrestrial stone is, in its complete perfection, on the
whole possible, whether the ethical ideal in absolute
purity can be pragmatically realized.]
</p>

<p>
<q>Whereupon after a short blocking and stilling
of my external senses, I received this answer [of the
Bridegroom]; that this could not be until a complete
death of the body of sin was suffered, showing me
that which is written in the 6th verse of the seventh
chapter of Romans, that after that was perished and
dead, wherein we were held, we should serve God in
newness of spirit.</q> (L. G. B., I, pp. 50 ff.)
</p>

<p>
[Here we have then the requirement to become
wholly dead to the realm of sin, in order to be able
to rise fully to the ethical ideal. The question
whether this is possible in life remains open, to be
sure. In symbolism this mystical death and the
union with the highest spirit was represented symbolically
in the highest degree of freemasonry. The
representative of the Highest is the Master degree
of the M. v. St. and he fills the dead, as it were,
with his life, as the raising takes place (H in H, F
against F, K against K, etc.), like the reviving of
the child by Elijah (I Kings XVIII, 21). As for the
necessary decay of the body before the raising
(<q>The skin leaves,</q> etc.) let us quote the passage,
L. G. B., I, pp. 271 ff.: [the divine word speaks]
<q>Know ... that I have not left thee without a
<pb n="405"/><anchor id="Pg405"/>
potent and rich talent which lies in thine own keeping,
although deep hidden and covered with a threefold
covering (Exod., XXXIX 34, Num. IV, 5, 6),
which must be removed before thou canst see this
costly garment. The first covering is the coarse
dark appearance of this earthly realm ... the second
is the fast-binding [directed upon the mundane]
reason ... the third is the baser natural senses....
Provided that thou thoroughly determine with
the firm resolution to break through these three obstacles,
thou wilt come to the golden mass....
While it is given to ye then to know where the treasure
really lies [Seeking out of the grave. The three
murderers, who have hidden the corpse, are these
very <q>three obstacles.</q>] and you have my spirit on
this, which will not alone seek for it but will with
the hand of its strength strongly coöperate with you;
[To revive the mystical dead.] so resolve as
united in the spirit ... to break through that and
to break it up, which lies as a covering over this
princely being.... Pray and do not only wait [no
idle mysticism] but struggle and work until you have
released, set free and liberated this power hidden
in a prison; which may be exalted upon the throne
of empire, since in truth my spirit as well as yours
has hitherto not been displaced from its kingdom
except by force and unrighteousness.</q> [With reference
to the raising (cf. L. G. B., III, pp. 87, 91); in
that place three degrees of mystical development are
described in the similitude of three altars. Under
the last altar, which is built of quadrangular stones,
<pb n="406"/><anchor id="Pg406"/>
in which one can see his own face as in mirrors, lies
the life trampled to death, which will again be
wakened.]
</p>

<p>
<q>Knowest thou not, I was asked, that the law
of sin has the mastery as long as it [the body with
its selfish tendencies] lives? So that the spirit
clearly bore witness and gave me to understand that
nothing could make me worthy of this marriage with
the Lamb [unio mystica] except an absolute death,
since he wedded only the maidenly spirit, to be one
flesh with him, [H in H, F against F, etc.] and by
so doing changed it into his own pure manhood.
[Humanity.] And this is the generation or birth
to an actively self-sufficient being, which rises out of
the old one. For just as the grain of wheat perishes
or dies in the earth and comes into a new life, just so
it goes also with the arising and the growing up of
the new creation, which in truth is Christ our life,
whose appearance will put an end to the sins in us.
For, dear one, what has brought on the curse, care,
trouble, misery, weaknesses, which press and torture
the poor man in this fallen state of his but the departing
from God? And as long as he is in this
condition, he is a debtor to sin and under its dominion;
which subjects him to all affliction and misery,
which are wont to follow the footsteps of those
who live in the elemental flesh. Now without doubt
it is good and joyful tidings to hear of a possibility
of drawing out and putting off this body of sins; and
in truth the prophet who has arisen in me has prophesied
that such a day was at hand. Be dismayed at
<pb n="407"/><anchor id="Pg407"/>
it, ye that are the wounders and despisers of this
grace; which I see is now near being revealed, for the
bridal garments are being prepared ... [Cf. the
end of the parable.] O Wisdom, the preparation
and ordering of the bridal garments is given in
charge to you alone, which shall be of divers colors,
with which the king's daughter, [Analogue of the
king's son, the improved son figure of the parable.]
who is entrusted to thy teaching and instruction, may
be distinguished from all others, and known [as redeemed].</q>
(L. G. B., I, pp. 51 ff., wherewith the
magic journey is ended.)
</p>

<p>
Thus there is a confident tone, a hope in that which
loses itself in the infinite. But Leade suspects that
it is an unattainable ideal and knows what regulative
import it has: <q>Ah, who up to this hour has traveled
so far, and what are all our realized gifts until
we have reached this goal [union with the Divinity].
Can our plummet even sound it and explore in the
deep abyss, the matchless wonder of the immeasurable
being? And because the revolving wheel of my
spirit has found no rest in all that it has seen, known,
possessed and enjoyed, it stretched its errant senses
continuously towards what was still held back, and
kept, by the strong rock of omnipotence; to struggle
towards which with a fresh attack I resolutely determined,
and would be sent away with nothing less
than the kingdom and the ruling power of the Holy
Ghost.</q> (L. G. B., I, p. 87.)
</p>

<p>
In a parallel between the old and new royal art,
I cannot overlook the French masonic writer Oswald
<pb n="408"/><anchor id="Pg408"/>
Wirth, who has worked in the same province. I
agree with him in general; although much of his
method of interpretation seems to me too arbitrary.
I have already called attention to several passages
from W. S. H. on the preparation of the subject
[i.e., the uninitiated]. I will endeavor to outline
the contents of the rest of the work according to the
ideas of Wirth.
</p>

<p>
Having given up himself, the Subjectum is overcome
in the philosophic egg [preparation chamber,
i.e., sch. K.] by sadness and suffering. His strength
ebbs away, the decomposition begins; the subtle is
separated from the coarse. [Smaragdine tablet.]
That is the first phase of the air test. After descending
to the center of the earth [Visita interiora terrae,
etc.&mdash;Smaragdine tablet, 6, 8.] where the roots of
all individuality meet, the spirit rises up again
[Smaragdine tablet, 10.] released from the caput
mortuum, which is blacked on the floor of the hermetic
receptacle. The residuum is represented by
the cast-off raiment of the novice. Laboriously now,
he toils forward in the darkness; the heights draw
him on; escaping hell he will attain to heaven. His
ascent up the holy mountain is hindered by a violent
storm; he is thrown into the depths by the tempest:
a symbol of circulation in the closed vessel of the
alchemists, which vessel corresponds to the protected
lodge. During the circulation the volatile parts rise
and fall again like rain, which is symbolized by the
tears upon the walls. To be sure, it is not here that
the neophyte is subjected to the water test, and if a
<pb n="409"/><anchor id="Pg409"/>
confusion is possible on this point it comes from the
fact that all the operations of the great work go on
in one vessel, while the masonic initiation is completed
in a suite of different rooms, so that the symbolic
series here suffers disintegration. The circulating
water, which soaks into the pores of the
earthly parts of the subject, purifies it more and more,
so that it goes from gray through a series of colors
(peacock's tail) to white. In this stage the material
corresponds to the wise man who knows how to resist
all seduction. Yet we are not to be satisfied with
this negative virtue; the fire test (we should remember
that the four tests by the elements were to be
found in the parable also) is still to be gone through,
the calcination, which burns everything combustible.
After the calcination there is a perfectly purified
salt [Symbol: Salt] of absolute transparence. So long as the
novice has not attained this moral clearness, the light
cannot be vouchsafed to him. In brief, in the first
degree, the main thing is the comprehensive purification.
The salt layers must be made crystal clear,
that surround the inner sulphur [Symbol: Sulphur] like a crust and
hinder it from its free radiation. Sulphur is to be
regarded as a symbol of the expansive power, as individual
initiative, as will. Mercury stands opposite
to it as woman does to man, as that which goes to
the subject from without, or as absolute receptivity.
Salt is midway between both; in it the equilibrium
between [Symbol: Sulphur] and [Symbol: Mercury] is found. It is a symbol of what
appears as the stable being of man. In the first degree
the purification of the salt is worked out for
<pb n="410"/><anchor id="Pg410"/>
the release of the sulphur. The red column J corresponds
to the red sulphur, by which symbolically the
novices get their reward. For the rest, the first degree
is satisfied with getting the novices to see the
universal light (the blazing star). (W. S. H., pp.
88-92.)
</p>

<p>
The fire test takes place in the second degree.
The fiery sulphur must be worked out or rather sent
out and used for work. The field of activity of the
member proportions itself, as it were, according to
the expansion or range of its sulphurous radiation.
At this time the member enters into a relation of
such intensified activity with the world that the intellectual
grasp [which corresponds to the [Symbol: Mercury] = principal]
acquires from it a new illumination [blazing
star], and breaks away for a connection of the will,
which was at first merely individual, with the collectivity.
To me at least that appears to be the
sense of the figurative but not quite clear exposition
of W. S. H., pp. 952-962, which I have, for the
sake of exactness, given in the original text. [See
Appendix, <ref target="Note_I">Note I</ref>.] As soon as the crude stone is
cut and polished we have no longer to work inward
but outward. What we are to accomplish so creatively
would be insignificant if we did not know the
secret of borrowing power from a power that apparently
lies without us. Where do these mysterious
powers work if not at the pillar B, whose name
means: i. i. d. St.? In the north directed on the
contrary towards the moon, whose soft feminine
light it reflects, it corresponds to [Symbol: Mercury], which unceasingly
<pb n="411"/><anchor id="Pg411"/>
flows towards all being, in order to support its
central fire, [Symbol: Fire]. The exaltation of the latter leads
to the fire test, the idea of which Wirth seems to
take in strictly occult form, in the manner of Eliphas
Levi. Finally, a circulation takes place, in that the
individual will seeks like a magnet to draw the divine
will, always falls down again, rises, however, and so
on in cycles, till both meet in the <q>philosophical fire.</q>
It is the cycle of which we read in the Smaragdine
Tablet. The incombustible essence that comes forth
from the fire test is the phœnix (a figure much used
by the alchemists). The member has the task of
changing himself into the phœnix. Not only [Symbol: Fire]
belongs to the work, however, but also the act must
be guided by intelligence; activity and receptivity
must complement each other. Therefore the member
has to know both pillars thoroughly. And
therefore he becomes also the already mentioned
androgynous material, Rebis. That is only to be
attained when the elemental propensities are overcome,
therefore the figure Rebis is represented as
standing on the dragon. (W. S. H., pp. 96-101.)
</p>

<p>
What will the master do now? He will identify
himself with the Master Builder of all worlds, in
order to work in him and through him. When any
one says that that is mysticism, he is not wrong.
Being developed on the three successive ways of purgatio,
illuminatio, and unio, this mysticism is no less
logical than the religious mysticism that with its
mortifications, if it were only rightly understood,
would accomplish the same purpose. Mortification
<pb n="412"/><anchor id="Pg412"/>
is, as the word itself says, the endeavor for a certain
kind of death. Twice is the mason enjoined to die;
at the beginning in the preparation room and at the
end at the final initiation into the inmost chamber.
The second death corresponds to the perfection of the
grand mastery. It signifies the complete sacrifice of
his personality, the renunciation of every personal
desire. It is the effacement of that radical egotism
that caused the fall of Adam, in that he dragged
down spirituality into corporeality. The narrow
pusillanimous ego melts into nothing before the high
impersonal self, symbolized by Hiram. The mythical
sins of the eternal universal human Adam are
thus expatiated. The architect of the temple is to
the Grand Master Builder of All Worlds (G. B. a.
W.) just what in Christian symbolism the Word
become flesh is to the Eternal Father. In order to
carry on the work of the universal structure with
advantage the Master must enter into the closest
union of the will with God. No longer a slave in
anything he is the more a master of all, the more his
will works in harmony with the one that rules the
universe. <q>Placed between the abstract and the
concrete, between the creative intelligence and the objective
creation, man thus conceived, appears like the
mediator par excellence, or the veritable Demiurge
of the gnostics.</q> Yet it is not enough that he gets
light from its original source, he must also be bound
by endless activity to those whom he is to lead. The
necessary bond is sympathy, love. <q>The master
must make himself loved and he can only succeed by
<pb n="413"/><anchor id="Pg413"/>
himself loving with all the warmth of a generosity
extending even to absolute devotion, even to the sacrifice
of himself.</q> The pelican [We are already
acquainted with this hermetic bird.] is the hieroglyph
for this loving sacrifice without which every
effort remains vain. (W. S. H., p. 105.)
</p>

<p>
The master's degree, this necessarily last degree,
corresponds to an ideal that is set us as a task: we
must strive towards it even if its realization is beyond
our powers. Our temple will never be finished,
and no one expects to see the true eternal Hiram
arise in himself. (W. S. H., p. 94.)
</p>

<p>
We find also in Wirth, how the work is divided
into three main steps, which begin with the purifying,
turn towards the inner soul, and end with the
death-resembling Unio Mystica; here we find, too, in
the last degree the unattainable ideal, which like a
star in heaven shall give a sure course to the voyage
of our life. The viewing of the exalted anagogic
conception as a perspective vanishing point, makes
allowance for the possible errors of superposition in
the anagogic aspect of the elementary types.
</p>

<p>
The tripartite division, which we meet in the great
work, shows the frequently doubted inner qualification
of the three degrees of freemasonry. As they
answer a need, they have again prevailed, although
they were not existent in the masonic form of the
royal art at the beginning (about two centuries ago);
I say <q>again,</q> because similar needs have already
earlier produced similar forms. (Cf. L. Keller's
writings.) Whether we consider ethical education
<pb n="414"/><anchor id="Pg414"/>
in general or the intensive (introversion) form of it,
mysticism, we have in either case a process of development,
and degrees are necessary to express it symbolically.
The effort, appearing from time to time,
to multiply the degrees has been justified. We can
divide what is divided into three sections into seven
also (7 operations in alchemy, 7 levels of contemplation,
7 ordinations, etc.), although it is not really
needed. But the idea of abolishing the three degrees
can only arise from a misapprehension of the
value of the existing symbolism. That masonry is
a union of equal rights is not affected by the presence
of the degrees, provided that their symbolic significance
is not overstepped. The degrees form a
constituent part of the symbolic custom itself and
like it are to be intangible.
</p>

<p>
The symbols of all the lofty spiritual religious
communities, for which the royal art presents itself
as a paradigm or exemplar, put before us, as
it were, types of truth. Single facts which the symbols
may signify (or that could be read into the symbols)
are not the most important, but rather the
totality of all these meanings. The totality (which
can be acquired only by a sort of integration) is
something inexpressible; and if it also succeeded in
expressing this inexpressible, the words of the expression
would be incomprehensible to any finite
spirit, as the individual facts are.
</p>

<p>
The symbols are the unchangeable, the individual
meanings are the variegated and the changeable.
[As for the masonic symbolism in particular, I am
<pb n="415"/><anchor id="Pg415"/>
in agreement with Robert Fischer (Kat. Erl., III,
fin.). <q>Freemasonry rests on symbols and ceremonies;
in that lies its superior title to continued
existence. They are created for eternal verities and
peculiarly adapted thereto; they are fitted to every
grade of culture, indeed to every time, and do not fall
like other products of the time, a sacrifice to time
itself.... Therefore a complete abolition of our
symbols can meet with assent as little as an enfeeblement
of them can be desired. Much more must we
strive in order that a clear understanding may sift
out the abstract, corresponding to our spiritual eye,
from the concrete necessary for our physical eye, so
that the combined pictures shall be resolved in the
simple fundamental truths. By this means the symbols
attain life and motion and cannot be put down
for things that decay with time.</q>] Therefore the
symbols should never be changed in favor of a particular
meaning, which becomes the fashion (or be
brought closer to it over and above the given relation).
What is to be maintained through variations
of meaning, is not the meanings but the symbols
themselves.
</p>

<p>
To each person symbols represent his own truth.
To every one they speak a different language. No
one exhausts them. Every one seeks his ideal chiefly
in the unknown. It matters not so much what ideal
he seeks, but only that he does seek one. Effort itself,
not the object of effort, forms the basis of development.
No seeker begins his journey with full
knowledge of the goal. Only after much circulation
<pb n="416"/><anchor id="Pg416"/>
in the philosophic egg and only after much passing
through the prism of colors does that light dawn
which gives us the faint intimation of the outline of
the prototype of all lesser ideals. Whoever desires
hope of a successful issue to this progress must not
forget a certain gentle fire that must operate from
the beginning to the end, namely Love.

Note A (80). I put here not merely those comparisons
of motives which are alike at the beginning, but also
those that are important for our further consideration. My
rendering of them is partly abridged. Signs of similarity
are, as Stucken explains, not employed to express an absolute
congruence, but predominantly in the sense of <q>belongs
with</q> or <q>or is the alternate of.</q> Stucken's comparison
I, A, goes: Moses in the ark = spark of fire in the ark =
Pandora's books = Eve's apple; I, B: Moses in the ark =

hero [the one floating in the ark]. II, A: Eve's apple =
Moses in the ark = Onan's seed = fire = soma = draught
of knowledge, etc. III, B: Tearing open of the womb =
decapitation or dismemberment = exposure = separation of
the first parents. IV, B: The dismembered [man or woman]
= the rejuvenated = the reborn [m. or w.]. VI, A:
Potiphar motive = separation of first parents = Onan motive.
VII, A: The wicked stepmother = Potiphar's wife =
man eater. VII, B: Flight from the <q>man eater</q> = flight
from Potiphar's wife = flight from the wicked stepmother
= separation of the first parents = magic flight. IX, A:
The first parents = magic flight. IX, A: The killed ram =
Thor's ram = Thyestes' meal = soma. XIII, A: The exposed

Scapegoat = ark. XXVIII: Wrestling match = rape of
women = rape of soma = opening of the chest [opening of

ladies]. XXIX: Castration = tearing asunder [consuming]
of the mother's body = the final conflagration = the
deluge. XXXIII, A: Dragonfight = wrestling match =
winning of the offered king's daughter = rape of the women

motive. XL, B: Incest = violation of a [moral] prohibition.
XL, C: Seducer [male or female] to incest = <q>man-eater.</q>
XLIV, A: The father who rejects the daughter =

match. Otherwise is marriage of mortal with the immortal
= incest = separation of the first parents. (SAM Book

<p>
Note B (128). That the ideas of gold and offal
lie very near each other is shown in numerous forms and
variations in myth, fairy tale and popular superstition. I
mention above all the figure of the ducat or gold-dropper
which has probably been attenuated from a superstition to a
joke, and around it are gathered such expressions as <q>he has
gold like muck,</q> <q>he must have a gold dropper at his house</q>;
then the description of bloody hemorrhoids as golden veins;
the fabulous animals that produce as excrement gold and
precious things. Here belong also the golden ass [K. H. M.,
No. 36], which at the word <q>Bricklebrit</q> begins <q>to spew
gold from before and behind,</q> or [Pentam., No. 1], at the
command, <q>arre cacaure,</q> gives forth gold, pearls and diamonds
as a priceless diarrhea. [Arre is a word of encouragement
like our get-up; cacuare is derived naturally from
cacare, kacken = to cack, perhaps with an echo of aurum,
<pb n="419"/><anchor id="Pg419"/>
oro, gold.] It occurs frequently in sagas that animal dung,
e.g., horse manure, is changed into gold as, inversely, gold
sent by evil spirits is easily turned [again] into dung. Gold
is, in the ancient Babylonian way of thinking, which passes
over into many myths, muck of hell or the under world. If
a man buried a treasure so that no one should find it, he does
well to plant a cactus on the covered [treasure] as a guardian
of the gold, according to an old magical custom. An attenuation
of the comparison dung = gold seems to be coal =
gold. In Stucken we find the comparison excrement =
Rheingold = sperm [S. A. M., p. 262] and connected with
it [pp. 266 ff.] a mass of material mythologically connected
with it. I mention the similar parallels derived from dream
analysis (Stekel, Spr. d. Tr., passim), further in particular
the psychologically interesting contributions of Freud on
<q>Anal character</q> (Kl. Schr., pp. 132 ff.) like Rank's contribution.
(Jb. ps. F., IV, pp. 55 ff.)
</p>

<anchor id="Note_C"/>
<p>
Note C (280). According to Jung it is a characteristic
of the totality of the sun myth which relates that
the <q>fundamental basis of the <q>incestuous</q> desire is not
equivalent to cohabitation, but to the peculiar idea of becoming
a child again, to return to the parents' protection, to
get back into the mother again in order to be born again by
the mother. On the way to this goal stands incest, however,
i.e., necessity in some way to get back into the uterus
again. One of the simplest ways was to fructify the mother
and procreate oneself again. Here the prohibition against
incest steps in, so now the sun myths and rebirth myths teem
with all possible proposals as to how one could encompass
incest. A very significant way of encompassing it is to
change the mother into another being or rejuvenate her, in
order to make her vanish after the resulting birth [respective
propagation], i.e., to cause her to change herself back. It
is not incestuous cohabitation that is sought, but rebirth, to
<pb n="420"/><anchor id="Pg420"/>
which one might attain quickest by cohabitation. This, however,
is not the only way, although perhaps the original one.</q>
(Jung, Jb. ps. F., IV, pp. 266 ff.) In another place it is
said: The separation of the son from the mother signifies the
separation of man from the pairing consciousness of animals,
from the lack of individual consciousness characteristic of
infantile archaic thought. <q>First by the force of the incest
prohibition could a self-conscious individual be produced,
who had before been, thoughtlessly one with the genus, and
only so first could the idea of the individual and conclusive
death be rendered possible. So came, as it were, death into
the world through Adam's sin. The neurotic who cannot
leave his mother has good reason; fear of death holds him
there. It appears that there is no concept and no word
strong enough to express the meaning of this conflict.
Whole religions are built to give value to the magnitude
of this conflict. This struggle for expression, enduring
thousands of years, cannot have the source of its power in
the condition which is quite too narrowly conceived by the
common idea of incest; much more apparently must we
conceive the law that expresses itself first and last as a
prohibition against incest as a compulsion toward domestication,
and describe the religious system as an institution that
most of all takes up the cultural aims of the not immediately
serviceable impulsive powers of the animal nature, organizes
them and gradually makes them capable of sublimated employment.</q>

Note D (274). Jung divides the libido into two
currents lengthwise, one directed forward, the other backward:
<q>As the normal libido is like a constant stream,
which pours its waters into the world of reality, so the resistance,
dynamically regarded, is not like a rock raised in the
river bed, which is flowed over and around by the stream,
<pb n="421"/><anchor id="Pg421"/>
but like a back current flowing towards the source instead
of towards the mouth. A part of the soul probably wants
the external object, another part, however, prefers to return
to the subjective world, whither the airy and easily built
palaces of the phantasy beckon. We could assume this
duality of human will, for which Bleuler from his psychiatric
standpoint has coined the word ambitendency, as something
everywhere and always existing, and recall that even the
most primitive of all motor impulses are already contradictory
as where, e.g., in the act of extension, the flexor muscles
are innervated.</q> (Jb. ps. F., IV, p. 218.)
</p>

<anchor id="Note_E"/>
<p>
Note E (279). Of the wonderful abilities that pass
current as fruits of the yoga practice, the eight grand
powers [Maha-siddhi] are generally mentioned: 1. To
make oneself small or invisible [animan], 2, 3. to acquire the
uttermost lightness or heaviness [laghiman, gariman], 4. to
increase to the size of a monster and to reach everything even
the most distant, as e.g., to the moon with the tips of the
fingers [mahiman or prapti], 5. unobstructed fulfillment of
all wishes, e.g., the wish to sink into the earth as into water
and to emerge again [prakamya], 6. perfect control over the
body and the internal organs [isitva], 7. the ability to change
the course of nature [vasitva], and 8. by mere act of will
to place oneself anywhere [yatra kamavasayitva]. Besides
these eight marvelous powers many others might be named,
which are partly included in the above; such an exaltation of
sensitiveness that the most remote and imperceptible images,
the happenings in other worlds on planets and stars, as also
the goings on in one's own interior and in other men's are
perceived by the senses; the knowledge of the past and the
future, of previous existences and of the hour of death; understanding
the language of animals, the ability to summon
the dead, etc. These miraculous powers, however, suffer
<pb n="422"/><anchor id="Pg422"/>
from the disadvantages of being transitory, like everything
else won by man through his merit&mdash;with the exception of
salvation. (Garbe, Samkhya and Yoga, p. 46.)
</p>

<anchor id="Note_F"/>
<p>
Note F (305). Jung (Jb., Ill, p. 171) refers to
Maeterlinck's <q>inconscient supérieur</q> (in <q>La Sagesse
et la Destinée</q>) as a prospective potentiality of subliminal
combinations. He comments on it as follows: <q>I shall
not be spared the reproach of mysticism. Perhaps the matter
should none the less be pondered: doubtless the unconscious
contains the psychological combinations that do not reach the
liminal value of consciousness. Analysis resolves these combinations
into their historical determinants for that is one
of the essential tasks of analysis, i.e., to render powerless
by disconnecting them, the obsessions of the complexes that
are concurrent with the purposeful conduct of life. History
is ignorant of two kinds of things: what is hidden in the
past and what is hidden in the future. Both are probably
to be attained with a certain measure of probability, the
former as a postulate, the latter as a historical prognosis.
In so far as to-morrow is contained in to-day, and all the
warp of the future already laid, a deepened knowledge of
the present could make possible a more or less wide-reaching
and sure prognosis of the future. If we transfer this reasoning,
as Kant has already done, to the psychologic, the
following things must result; just as memory traces, which
have demonstrably become subliminal, are still accessible to
the unconscious, so also are certain very fine subliminal combinations
showing a forward tendency, which are of the
greatest possible significance for future occurrences in so far
as the latter are conditioned by our psychology. But just
as the science of history troubles itself little about the future
combinations which are rather the object of politics,
just so little are the psychological combinations the object
of the analysis, but would be rather the object of an infinitely
<pb n="423"/><anchor id="Pg423"/>
refined psychological synthesis, which should know how to
follow the natural currents of the libido. We cannot do
this, but probably the unconscious can, for the process takes
place there, and it appears as if from time to time in certain
cases significant fragments of this work, at least in dreams,
come to light, whence came the prophetic interpretation of
dreams long claimed by superstition. The aversion of the
exact [sciences] of to-day against that sort of thought-process
which is hardly to be called phantastic is only an overcompensation
of the thousands of years old but all too great inclination
of man to believe in soothsaying.</q>

<p>
Note G (317). The umbilical region plays no small
part as a localization point for the first inner sensations
in mystic introversion practices. The accounts of the
Hindu Yoga doctrine harmonize with the experiences of the
omphalopsychites. Staudenmaier thinks that he has, in his
investigations into magic, which partly terminated in the
calling up of extremely significant hallucinations, observed
that realistic heavenly or religious hallucinations take place
only if the <q>specific</q> nerve complexes [of the vegetative
system] are stimulated as far down as the peripheral tracts
in the region of the small intestine. (Magie als exp.
Naturw., p. 123.) Many visionary authors know how to
relate marvels of power to the region of the stomach and of
the solar plexus. In an essay on the seat of the soul, J. B.
van Helmont assures us that there is a stronger feeling in
the upper orifice of the stomach than in the eye itself, etc.;
that the solar plexus is the most essential organ of the soul.
He recounts the following experience. In order to make
an experiment on poisonous herbs he made a preparation of
the root of aconite [Aconitum napellus] and only tasted it
with the tip of his tongue without swallowing any of it.
<q>Immediately,</q> he says, <q>my skin seemed to be constricted
as with a bandage, and soon after, there occurred an extraordinary
<pb n="424"/><anchor id="Pg424"/>
thing, the like of which I had never experienced before.
I noticed with astonishment that I felt, perceived and
thought no longer with my head, but in the region of my
stomach, as if knowledge had taken its seat in the stomach.
Amazed at this unusual phenomenon, I questioned myself
and examined myself carefully. I merely convinced myself
that my power of perception was now much stronger and
more comprehensive. The spiritual clearness was coupled
with great pleasure. I did not sleep nor dream, I was still
temperate and my health perfect. I was at times in raptures,
but they had nothing in common with the fact of
feeling with the stomach, which excluded all coöperation
with the head. Meantime my joy was interrupted by the
anxiety that this might even bring on some derangement.
Only my belief in God and my resignation to his will soon
destroyed this fear. This condition lasted two hours, after
which I had several attacks of giddiness. I have since often
tried to taste of aconite, but I could not get the same result.</q>
(Van Helmont, Ortus Medic, p. 171, tr. Ennemoser,
Gesch. d. Mag., p. 913.)
</p>

<anchor id="Note_H"/>
<p>
Note H (381). For the old as for the new royal
art the material is man, as man freed from all framework.
<q>Not man of the conventional social life, but man as the
equally entitled and equally obligated being of divine creation,
enters the temple of humanity with the obligation
always to remain conscious of his duty and to put aside
everything that comes up to hinder the fulfillment of the
highest duty.</q> (R. Fischer.) Compare with this what
Hitchcock says of the material of the Philosopher's Stone:
<q>Although men are of diverse dispositions ... yet the alchemists
insist ... that all the nations of men are of one
blood, that is, of one nature; and that character in man, by
which he is one nature, it is the special object of alchemy to
bring into life and action, by means of which, if it could universally
<pb n="425"/><anchor id="Pg425"/>
prevail, mankind would be constituted into a brotherhood.</q>
(H. A., pp. 48 ff.) [The tests] ... <q>begin
with the stripping of the metals. Now alchemy recommends,
once the propitious matter is seen, carefully examined
and recognized, to clean it externally for the purpose of freeing
it of every foreign body that could adhere accidentally to
its surface. The matter, in fine, should be reduced to itself.
Now it is an absolutely analogous matter that the candidate
is called to strip himself of everything that he possesses artificially;
both it and he ought to be reduced strictly to themselves.
In this state of primitive innocence, of philosophic
candor retrieved, the subject is imprisoned in a narrow retreat
where no external light can penetrate. This is the
chamber of meditation which corresponds to the matras of
the alchemist, to his philosophic egg hermetically sealed. The
uninitiated finds there a dark tomb where he must voluntarily
die to his former existence. By decomposing the integuments
that are opposed to the true expansion of the germ
of individuality, this symbolic death precedes the birth of the
new being who is to be initiated.</q> (W. S. H., pp. 87 ff.)
</p>

<anchor id="Note_I"/>
<p>
Note I (411). As to the Chamber of the Companion
hung in red, it represents the sphere of action of our
individuality, measured by the extent of our sulphurous radiation.
This radiation produces a kind of refractive [refringent]
medium, which refracts the surrounding diffused
light [[Symbol: Mercury] is meant] to concentrate it on the spiritual nucleus
of the subject. Such is the mechanism of the illumination,
by which those benefit who have seen the blazing star shine.
Every being bears in himself this mysterious star, but too
often in the condition of a dim spark hardly perceptible. It
is the philosophic child, the immanent Logos or the Christ
incarnate, which legend represents as born obscurely in the
midst of the filth of a cave serving as a stable. The initiation
becomes the vestal of this inner fire [Symbol: Sulfur]; archetype or
<pb n="426"/><anchor id="Pg426"/>
principle of all individuality. She knows how to care for it
as long as it is brooded in the ashes. Then she devotes herself
to nourishing it judiciously, to render it keen for the
moment when it finally should overcome the obstacles that
imprison it and seek to hold it in isolation. It means, as
a matter of fact, that the Son is put en rapport with the
external [Symbol: Mercury], or in other words, that the individual enters
into communion with the collectivity from which he comes.
